### 13.1.3 Glowy Ultrasonic Sensor Introduction

The ultrasonic ranging chip integrates ultrasonic transmitting circuit, receiving circuit, digital processing circuit, etc. This module adopts IIC communication interface through which the measured distance can be read.

Besides, on each probe, there is RGB light whose brightness can be adjusted and parameters of color channel can be modified to change the color.

### 13.1.4 Program Logic

Firstly, set the distance range. Then control RGB colored light to light on or get out though the change of the level. Lastly, control the color of light through changing the parameter of color channels.

The source code of this program is stored in [/home/ubuntu/puppypi/src/puppy_extend_demo/scripts/sonar_control_demo.py]()

### 13.1.5 Operation Steps

:::{Note}

Commands must be entered with strict attention to capitalization and spaces.

:::

(1) Turn on PuppyPi, and connect it to Raspberry Pi desktop via VNC.

(2) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image3.png" style="width:70px" /> at upper left corner to to open Terminator.

(3) Enter the following command and press Enter to run the game program.

```
rosrun puppy_extend_demo sonar_control_demo.py
```

(4) If need to close this program, we can press `Ctrl+C`. If it fails to close, please try again.

### 13.1.6 Program Outcome

After the program starts, place an obstacle in front of the glowy ultrasonic sensor. Then the measured distance will be printed on the terminal. And the RGB colored light will illuminate in corresponding color according to the distance.

**Distance ≤ 300mm**: red light on.

**300mm≤ Distance ≤ 500mm**: green light on.

**Distance ≥500mm**: blue light on.

(4) Modify the values as the picture shown.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_13/section_1/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

(5) After modification, press "Esc", input" :wq"and press Enter to save and exit editing.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_13/section_1/media/image13.png" class="common_img" />

* **Customize RGB Color**

Likewise, we can change the color of RGB light, for example yellow.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_13/section_1/media/image14.png" class="common_img" />

(3) The color of RGB light can be changed through modifying RGB values. Modify `setRGB(1,(255,0,0))` as `setRGB(1,(255,255,0))`, and `setRGB(0,(255,0,0))` as `setRGB(0,(255,255,0))`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_13/section_1/media/image15.png" class="common_img" />

RGB value refers to the content of Red, Green and Blue colors in one color. And all the colors can be constructed from the combination of the Red, Green and Blue colors.

### 13.3.2 Touch Sensor Introduction

Based on capacitive sensing, Hiwonder touch sensor can sense the touch from human body or metal. In addition, the contact between plastic, paper and other materials of certain thickness can also be sensed. Its sensitivity is related to contact area and material thickness.

After powering, signal terminals OUT will output high-level signal when sensor does not sense the touch signal. When the touch signal is sensed, signal terminal OUT will output low-level signal. It is applicable in switch control, such as light switch and doorbell touch buttons. The holes on the module are compatible with Lego for more creative DIY designs.

### 13.3.3 Program Logic

When sensing the touch, touch sensor will output high level, otherwise out low level. We can judge the status of the sensor through the level change of I/O interface.

The source code of this program is stored in [/home/ubuntu/puppypi/src/puppy_extend_demo/scripts/touch_detect_demo.py]()

### 13.3.4 Operation Steps

### 13.4.2 Dot Matrix Display Introduction

Dot matrix display module composed of two 8x8 LED dot matrix screens, which can be controlled through driving the control chip. It features high brightness, no-flicker display, convenient wiring, etc. And it can display various content, including number, text, pattern, etc.

### 13.4.3 Program Logic

In this program, a set of hexadecimal data is used to control the dot matrix screen to display the content. A set of hexadecimal data consists of 16 data each of which controls a column of LED.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_13/section_4/02/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

It is simple to set the data. For example, control the dot matrix display to display **Hello**.

The parameter in brackets of 32nd and 33rd line are the array for setting the displayed pattern. The converted binary number of its first element `0x7f` is 01111111 which represents the light status, that is off on on on on on on on.

As the same, the rest 15 elements are also for controlling the LED lights to display "Hello".

:::{Note}

You can find "Instructions for Using the Font Software" in the same directory of this section, where you can quickly obtain control arrays using the font software.
