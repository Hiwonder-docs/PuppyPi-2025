# 30. ROS2-Lidar Course

## 30.1 Introduction to Lidar

### 30.1.1 Lidar Description

Lidar is a remote sensing device that utilizes laser technology to detect the position and speed of targets. Lidar offers high-ranging resolution, strong penetrability, excellent anti-interference ability, and remarkable anti-stealth capability.

There are three types of Lidar based on ranging principles: Triangulation Lidar, Pulse Lidar, and Coherent Lidar. The Lidar used by PuppyPi is a Pulse Lidar.

### 30.1.2 Lidar Working Principle

Lidar is composed of laser emitting system, scanning system, laser receiving system and signal processing system.

Firstly, laser emitting system will send the detection signal (laser beam), and the scanning system takes charge of scanning the surrounding to receive the related information.

Next, the laser receiving system will receive the laser reflected by the target object to generate receiving signal.

Lastly, the signal system will process the receiving signal to get the features of the target, such as shape and physical properties (position, height and speed), then build the model.

### 30.1.3 Lidar Parameter

The specifications of the laser radar used in the PuppyPi robot dog are as follows:

* **Electrical and Mechanical Parameters**

## 30.2 Lidar Ranging Principle

### 30.2.1 Lidar Ranging

Lidar can range the distance in two ways, including triangulation ranging and TOF.

The working principle of TOF is as pictured. Firstly, Lidar will cast the light on the object, and the object will reflect the light on the Lidar. Then Lidar will calculate the time taken for light to return, and multiply the time times the speed of light to get the distance between object and it.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_30/section_2/media/image2.png" style="width:5.76597in;height:2.18681in" alt="图片3" />

Triangulation ranging is as the picture shown. During Lidar production, its angle of light casting on the object will be adjusted to let the light not directly hit on the object, but at a certain angle. This angle is set in advance and will not change during operation. And we can calculate the distance from the object to the Lidar by substituting this angle into the trigonometric function.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_30/section_2/media/image3.png" style="width:5.76389in;height:2.22986in" alt="图片4" />

### 30.2.2 Lidar Working Result

Its working result is as follows. Lidar will emit light and shine it on the object surface. When receiving the light reflected by the object, Lidar will mark the contour of the object at the position where the light is reflected.

## 30.3 Lidar Obstacle Avoidance

If you want to know how to connect PuppyPi Pro to the APP, please refer to the material in "[**2.APP and Handle Control ->2.1 APP Installation and Connection**](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/PuppyPi/en/latest/docs/2_play_first_hand.html#app-installation-and-connection)".

### 30.3.1 Operation Steps

(1) Turn on PuppyPi and connect it to the Raspberry Pi desktop through VNC.

(2) Click the upper left icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_26/section_1/media/image3.png" style="width:70px" /> to open Terminator terminal.

(3) Input the following command and press Enter to terminate all ROS2 node.

```bash
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Open a new command-line terminal, and execute the following command to initiate the Lidar game.

```bash
ros2 launch app lidar_node.launch.py
```

(5) Input the command below and press Enter to start the Lidar game.

```bash
ros2 service call /lidar_app/enter std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```

(6) After a successful startup, enter the following command and press Enter to enable the Lidar obstacle avoidance feature.

```bash
ros2 service call /lidar_app/set_running puppy_control_msgs/srv/SetInt64 data:\\ 1
```

:::{Note}

 If you want to view the source code, you can find the `lidar.py` file in the `/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app` folder within the Docker container.

:::

(7) To stop the obstacle avoidance feature, enter the following command and press Enter:

```bash
ros2 service call /lidar_app/set_running puppy_control_msgs/srv/SetInt64 data:\ 0
```

(8) To completely exit the feature, enter the following command and press Enter:

```bash
ros2 service call /lidar_app/exit std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```

:::{Note}

The feature will continue to run as long as the Raspberry Pi remains powered on, unless explicitly exited. To prevent excessive memory usage, ensure the current feature is closed using the above command before starting another one.

:::

### 30.3.2 Program Outcome

Here, we use a book as the object to be detected. It is important to note that when using the lidar tracking function, the object to be detected should be higher than the scanning height of the lidar. This allows PuppyPi onboard lidar to effectively scan its position information. Then, the PuppyPi moves straight ahead. When an obstacle is detected, the PuppyPi will automatically turn to avoid the obstacle.

### 30.3.3 Program Analysis

* **Launch Brief Analysis**

The Launch file path is **[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/launch/lidar_node.launch.py](../_static/source_code/ros2/lidar_node.launch.zip)**

First, launch the lidar with the following command: "**\$(find ldlidar)/launch/LD06.launch**". Then, start a node named lidar_app, using the lidar.py file from the lidar_app package. The parameters "output="screen"" indicate that the node's output will be displayed in the terminal, while "respawn="false"" means that the node will not restart if it unexpectedly terminates.

"**lidar.py**" is the source code file of this program, you can check it in this path "**/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app**".

* **Source Code Program Brief Analysis**

The source code of this program is stored in **[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/app/app/lidar.py](../_static/source_code/ros2/lidar.zip)**

(1) Initialization

```python
class LidarController(Node):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.running_mode = 0  # 雷达避障模式 2: 雷达警卫模式 (1: Radar obstacle avoidance mode, 2: Radar guard mode)
        self.threshold = 0.9  # meters  距离阈值(distance threshold)
        self.scan_angle = math.radians(90)  # radians  向前的扫描角度(the forward scanning angle)
        self.speed = 0.12  # 单位米，避障模式的速度 (speed in meters per second for obstacle avoidance mode)
        self.timestamp = 0
        self.lock = RLock()
        self.lidar_sub = None
        self.heartbeat_timer = None

        # 创建Publisher
        self.velocity_pub = self.create_publisher(Twist, '/cmd_vel_nav', 10)
        self.velocity_pub.publish(Twist())

        # 创建服务
        self.enter_srv = self.create_service(Trigger, '/lidar_app/enter', self.enter_func)
        self.exit_srv = self.create_service(Trigger, '/lidar_app/exit', self.exit_func)
        self.heartbeat_srv = self.create_service(SetBool, '/lidar_app/heartbeat', self.heartbeat_srv_cb)
        self.set_running_srv = self.create_service(SetInt64, "/lidar_app/set_running", self.set_running_srv_callback)
        self.set_parameters_srv = self.create_service(SetFloat64List, "/lidar_app/adjust_parameters", self.set_parameters_srv_callback)
```

rospy.init_node(name, anonymous=True): Initialize a ROS node, using the provided name as the node's name, and set anonymous to True.

self.name: Store the incoming name as an attribute of the object. Other attributes include some parameters controlling the Lidar, such as operation mode, threshold, scanning angle, speed, etc.

self.lock: A thread lock has been created for secure access in a multi-threaded environment.

(2) Create ROS service

```python
# 创建服务
self.enter_srv = self.create_service(Trigger, '/lidar_app/enter', self.enter_func)
self.exit_srv = self.create_service(Trigger, '/lidar_app/exit', self.exit_func)
self.heartbeat_srv = self.create_service(SetBool, '/lidar_app/heartbeat', self.heartbeat_srv_cb)
self.set_running_srv = self.create_service(SetInt64, "/lidar_app/set_running", self.set_running_srv_callback)
self.set_parameters_srv = self.create_service(SetFloat64List, "/lidar_app/adjust_parameters", self.set_parameters_srv_callback)
```

A ROS service named "**/enter**" has been created with the type Trigger, and the callback function is set to enter_func. When this service is called, it will execute the enter_func function.

A ROS service named "**/exit**" has been created with the type Trigger, and the callback function is set to exit_func. When this service is called, it will execute the exit_func function.

A ROS service named "**/set_running**" has been created with the type SetInt64, and the callback function is set to set_running_srv_callback. When this service is called, it will execute the set_running_srv_callback function.

A ROS service named "**/set_parameters**" has been created with the type SetFloat64List, and the callback function is set to set_parameters_srv_callback. When this service is called, it will execute the set_parameters_srv_callback function.

A Heart object has been created, using the ROS topic "**/%s/heartbeat**", with a set interval of 5 seconds. This is used to execute the heartbeat_srv_cb function when a message is triggered.

(3) Lidar obstacle avoidance

```python
    def lidar_callback(self, lidar_data: LaserScan):
        ranges = list(lidar_data.ranges)
        ranges = [9999.0 if r < 0.05 else r for r in ranges]  # 小于5cm当作无限远(treat distances less than 5cm as infinity)
        twist = Twist()

        with self.lock:
            min_index = np.nanargmin(np.array(ranges))  # 找出距离最小值(find out the minimum value of distance)
            dist = ranges[min_index]
            angle = lidar_data.angle_min + lidar_data.angle_increment * min_index  # 计算最小值对应的角度 (calculate the angle corresponding to the minimum value)
            angle = angle if angle < math.pi else angle - math.pi * 2  # 处理角度 (handle angle)

            # 避障 (obstacle avoidance)
            if self.running_mode == 1 and self.timestamp <= time.time():
                if abs(angle) < self.scan_angle / 2 and dist < self.threshold:
                    twist.linear.x = self.speed / 6
                    twist.angular.z = self.speed * 3 * -np.sign(angle)
                    self.timestamp = time.time() + 0.8
                else:
                    twist.linear.x = self.speed
                    twist.angular.z = 0.0
                self.velocity_pub.publish(twist)
```

① if self.running_mode == 1 and self.timestamp <= time.time():

Checks whether the robot is in obstacle avoidance mode (`running_mode == 1`) and if the timestamp condition is met.

② if abs(angle) < self.scan_angle / 2 and dist < self.threshold:

Determines if the target obstacle is within the forward scanning range and if the distance to the obstacle is less than the set threshold.

twist.linear.x = self.speed / 6

Sets the linear velocity to one-sixth of \`self.speed\`, slowing down the robot's forward movement.

twist.angular.z = self.speed * 3 * -np.sign(angle):

Sets the angular velocity to rotate the robot away from the obstacle based on its direction.

self.timestamp = time.time() + 0.8:

Updates the timestamp to delay further obstacle avoidance actions for 0.8 seconds.

else:

If no obstacle is within range, the robot continues to move forward with a linear velocity of `self.speed` and an angular velocity of 0.

③ self.velocity_pub.publish(twist):

Publishes the `Twist` message to update the robot's velocity accordingly.

## 30.4 Lidar Guard

If you want to know how to connect PuppyPi Pro to the APP, please refer to the material in "[**2. APP and Handle Control ->2.1 APP Installation and Connection**](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/PuppyPi/en/latest/docs/2_play_first_hand.html#app-installation-and-connection)"

### 30.4.1 Program Logic

The program logic for Lidar guarding is as follows:

1. If the distance to the obstacle is less than the threshold and the deviation angle is greater than 10 degrees, the robot enters an avoidance state.
2. The robot adjusts its orientation to face the obstacle, with the camera directly facing the obstacle.
3. The robot stops moving if no qualifying obstacles are detected.

```

`super().__init__(name)`: Calls the constructor of the parent class to initialize the node with the given name.

`self.running_mode`: Defines the operating mode. 1 represents "**Lidar Obstacle Avoidance Mode**", and 2 represents "**Lidar Guard Mode**".

`self.threshold`: Sets the distance threshold to 0.9 meters. In obstacle avoidance mode, actions may be triggered if an object is detected within this distance.

`self.scan_angle`: Specifies the scanning angle as 90 degrees (converted to radians), defining the forward scanning range.

`self.speed`: Sets the movement speed in obstacle avoidance mode, measured in meters per second.

`self.timestamp, self.lock, self.lidar_sub, self.heartbeat_timer`: These are used to manage data synchronization and locking, ensuring data consistency.

(2) Create ROS service

```python
# 创建服务
self.enter_srv = self.create_service(Trigger, '/lidar_app/enter', self.enter_func)
self.exit_srv = self.create_service(Trigger, '/lidar_app/exit', self.exit_func)
self.heartbeat_srv = self.create_service(SetBool, '/lidar_app/heartbeat', self.heartbeat_srv_cb)

self.set_parameters_srv = self.create_service(SetFloat64List, "/lidar_app/adjust_parameters", self.set_parameters_srv_callback)
```

A ROS service named `/enter` has been created with the type Trigger, and the callback function is set to enter_func. When this service is called, it will execute the enter_func function.

A ROS service named `/exit` has been created with the type Trigger, and the callback function is set to exit_func. When this service is called, it will execute the exit_func function.

A ROS service named `/set_running` has been created with the type SetInt64, and the callback function is set to set_running_srv_callback. When this service is called, it will execute the set_running_srv_callback function.

A ROS service named `/set_parameters` has been created with the type SetFloat64List, and the callback function is set to set_parameters_srv_callback. When this service is called, it will execute the set_parameters_srv_callback function.

A Heart object has been created, using the ROS topic "**/%s/heartbeat**", with a set interval of 5 seconds. This is used to execute the heartbeat_srv_cb function when a message is triggered.

(3) Lidar guarding

```python
# 警卫看守 (guard duty)
elif self.running_mode == 3 and self.timestamp <= time.time():
    if dist < self.threshold and abs(math.degrees(angle)) > 10:
        twist.linear.x = 0.01  # x方向的校正(correction in the x-direction)
        twist.angular.z = self.speed * 3 * np.sign(angle)
        self.timestamp = time.time() + 0.4
     else:
		twist.linear.x = 0.0
		twist.angular.z = 0.0
	self.velocity_pub.publish(twist)

```

- `Obstacle Detection`: If an obstacle is detected within the set distance threshold and with a deviation angle greater than 10 degrees, the robot enters an avoidance state.

- `twist.linear.x = 0.01`: Sets a forward movement speed.

- `twist.angular.z = self.speed * 3 * np.sign(angle)`: Adjusts the rotation direction based on the obstacle's position, moving away from it.

- `self.timestamp = time.time() + 0.4`: Updates the timestamp to ensure commands are refreshed every 0.4 seconds.

- `No Obstacles`: If no qualifying obstacles are detected, the robot stops moving.

- `twist.linear.x = 0.0 and twist.angular.z = 0.0`: Sets both linear and angular velocities to zero, stopping the robot.

- `Command Publishing`: Publishes the defined movement commands to control the robot's motion.
