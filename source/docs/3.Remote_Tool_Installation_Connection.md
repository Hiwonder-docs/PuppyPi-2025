## 3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry

### 3.3.1 Docker Introduction

Docker, an open-source platform and tool, helps you to package, distribute, and run apps within containers. Container is a lightweight, independent, executable software package that includes the application code, runtime environment, system tools, system libraries and settings. Docker allows developers to package applications along with their dependencies, not just the application itself, facilitating rapid and consistent deployment across different environments. 
In technical terms, Docker utilizes Linux containerization technology of operating system, making the isolation between applications more efficient. And it can run multiple containers on the same physical machine, with each container being independent and not affecting each other.
After all, Docker can be understood as a tool that makes applications and their dependencies more portable and easier to manage, bringing great convenience to software development and deployment.

### 3.3.2 Docker General Commands

All the games and programs of this product will be run in the Docker container. In order to help users to quickly understand and get started with this product, the following introduces the general commands of Docker. 

(1) Start up the device and connect it with VNC remote connection tool according to "[**3.1 VNC Installation and Connection**](#anchor_3_1)".

(2)  Click the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image3.png" style="width:70px" /> on the left top corner of the system desktop to open Terminator terminal. 

<p id="anchor_3_3_2_1"></p>

* **Check Containers**

Command parameters instruction：`docker ps [OPTIONS]`

General parameters instruction:

(1) -a ：list all currently running containers + containers that have been run in the past.

(2) -l ：display recently created containers

(3) -n=? ：display recently created n containers

(4) -q ：silent mode, only display container number

In the command line terminal, enter "**docker ps -a**" to display running and previously run containers. "**container id**" is the ID of containers, "**image**" is the image name of this container, "**created**" is the created time of the container, "**status**" is current state of container.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image5.png"  />

* **Enter Containers**

According to "[**3.3.2 Docker General Commands -> Check Containers**](#anchor_3_3_2_1)" to get container ID (the only one). Input command "**docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu 82df /bin/bash**" to enter the container where the functional program is installed. The container ID can be abbreviated as long as it is the unique identification of this container.

```bash
docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu 82df /bin/bash
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image6.png"  />

* **Exit Containers**

There are two commands to exit containers:

(1) Input "**exit**" directly in terminal and press enter key. While the container will stop running and exit.

```bash
exit
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image7.png"  />

(2) Use the shortcut key combination **"ctrl+P+Q"**. The container will exit directly but remain running. You can input command "**docker ps**" in terminal to check the running containers. 

```bash
docker ps
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image8.png"  />

### 3.3.3 Convenient Tool Usage (MUST READ)

It is inconvenient to input command in the terminator terminal every time. Therefore, you can set command to enter the container in the terminator tool. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image9.png"  />

(1)  Right-click the terminator window, and click "**Preference**".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image10.png"  />

(2) Select **"Profiles->Command"**.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image11.png"  />

(3)  In the  column, input command **"xhost + && docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu puppypi /bin/zsh"** to enter the container. 

:::{Note}

82df is the container ID of the container with the functional games.

:::

```bash
xhost + && docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu puppypi /bin/zsh
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image12.png"  />

(4)  Then click to close. In this way, every time you open the terminal, you can enter directly to the container with the functional program. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/image13.png"  />



## 3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide

PuppyPi leverages Docker container technology to support both ROS1 and ROS2 functionalities within the system. By default, ROS1 is enabled. Before switching, please ensure you are clear on which ROS version is required for your application to ensure smooth and efficient operation.

If you need to switch between ROS1 and ROS2, simply follow the steps outlined below.

(1) **Power on the robot** and establish a connection to the remote control software **VNC**. For detailed instructions on how to connect via remote desktop, refer to: [3.1 VNC Installation and Connection](#anchor_3_1)

(2) Once connected to the remote desktop, **double-click** <img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image1.png"  /> Then, click the **"Execute"** button to launch the tool.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image2.png"  />



<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image3.png"  />

(3) In the interface, locate the option **"Select ROS Version"** and choose the desired ROS version you wish to switch to, as shown in the red box in the image.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image4.png"  />

①　**ROS1** refers to the ROS1 system.

②　**ROS2** refers to the ROS2 system.

(4) For example, to switch to **ROS2**, select the option highlighted in the red box in the image.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image5.png"  />

(5) After making your selection, click **"Save"** to apply the changes.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image6.png"  />

(6) Wait a moment for a confirmation dialog to appear. This indicates that the system environment has been successfully switched to ROS2.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image7.png"  />

(7) Click **"OK"** to close the confirmation dialog, then click **"Exit"** to exit the ROS version switch tool.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image8.png"  />

(8) **Double-click**<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image9.png"  />  (as shown in the image) and click **"Execute"** to start the process.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image10.png"  />

(9) Once the environment has refreshed, if the information displayed matches the image shown, this confirms that you have successfully entered the **ROS2 development environment**.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_4/image11.png"  />

(10) To switch back to **ROS1**, refer to step 3 and select the appropriate **ROS1 version** from the **"Select ROS Version"** dropdown menu.

## 3.5 Network Configuration Overview

This tutorial uses the MasterPi Pi5 version as an example, and it applies to other Pi5 models in this series as well.

The robot's network can be configured in two modes:

**① AP Mode:** The controller creates a hotspot that can be connected to by a smartphone. (Note: This mode does not connect to the external internet.)

**② STA mode:** The controller connects directly to a specified hotspot/Wi-Fi network. (This mode allows access to the external internet.)

By default, the robot operates in AP (direct connection) mode. The features and functions of the robot remain the same whether in AP mode or STA (local area network) mode.

### 3.5.1 AP Direct Connection Mode

* Mode Switching through Phone

Using t**he Android system** as an example, these instructions also apply to iOS.

(1) Open the "**WonderPi**" app on your phone. Then, go to "**Basic**" and select "**MasterPi**".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image1.png" style="width:700px" />

(2)  Tap the "**+**" button in the bottom right corner of the screen, and choose **"Direct Connection Mode".**

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image2.png" style="width:700px"/>



(3) Tap **"Connect to Device Hotspot"**. This will take you to your phone's settings to connect to the hotspot created by the robot.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image3.png" style="width:700px" />

(4) Look for a hotspot name starting with "**HW**". The password is "**hiwonder**".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image4.png" style="width:350px" />

:::{Note}
for iOS: Wait until the Wi-Fi icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image5.png" style="width:40px" /> appears in your phone's status bar before returning to the app. If you don't see the device listed, you can refresh by tapping the refresh icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_5/image6.png" style="width:50px" /> in the upper-right corner of the app.
