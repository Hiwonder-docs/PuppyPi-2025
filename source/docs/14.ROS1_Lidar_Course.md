# 14. ROS1-Lidar Course

## 14.1 Introduction to Lidar

### 14.1.1 Introduction to Lidar

Lidar is a remote sensing device that utilizes laser technology to detect the position and speed of targets. Lidar offers high-ranging resolution, strong penetrability, excellent anti-interference ability, and remarkable anti-stealth capability.

There are three types of Lidar based on ranging principles: Triangulation Lidar, Pulse Lidar, and Coherent Lidar. The Lidar used by PuppyPi is a Pulse Lidar.

### 14.1.2 Lidar Working Principle

Lidar is composed of laser emitting system, scanning system, laser receiving system and signal processing system.

Firstly, laser emitting system will send the detection signal (laser beam), and the scanning system takes charge of scanning the surrounding to receive the related information.

Next, the laser receiving system will receive the laser reflected by the target object to generate receiving signal.

Lastly, the signal system will process the receiving signal to get the features of the target, such as shape and physical properties (position, height and speed), then build the model.

### 14.1.3 Lidar Parameter

The specifications of the laser radar used in the PuppyPi robot dog are as follows:

(1)  Electrical and Mechanical Parameters

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_14/section_1/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Serial Port Specification 

You can connect Lidar to external system through the interfaces on Lidar. Based on communication protocol, it can acquire the point cloud data, device information and device status in real-time. And you can also set the working mode.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_14/section_1/image8.png"  />

## 14.2 Lidar Ranging Principle

### 14.2.1 Lidar Ranging

Lidar can range the distance in two ways, including triangulation ranging and TOF.

The working principle of TOF is as pictured. Firstly, Lidar will cast the light on the object, and the object will reflect the light on the Lidar. Then Lidar will calculate the time taken for light to return, and multiply the time times the speed of light to get the distance between object and it.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_14/section_2/image2.png"  alt="loading" />

Triangulation ranging is as the picture shown. During Lidar production, its angle of light casting on the object will be adjusted to let the light not directly hit on the object, but at a certain angle. This angle is set in advance and will not change during operation. And we can calculate the distance from the object to the Lidar by substituting this angle into the trigonometric function.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_14/section_2/image3.png"  alt="loading" />

### 14.2.2 Lidar Working Result

Its working result is as follows. Lidar will emit light and shine it on the object surface. When receiving the light reflected by the object, Lidar will mark the contour of the object at the position where the light is reflected.

### 14.3.2 Program Outcome

Here, we use a book as the object to be detected. It is important to note that when using the lidar tracking function, the object to be detected should be higher than the scanning height of the lidar. This allows PuppyPi onboard lidar to effectively scan its position information. Then, the PuppyPi moves straight ahead. When an obstacle is detected, the PuppyPi will automatically turn to avoid the obstacle.



### 14.3.3 Program Analysis

- #### Launch Brief Analysis

The Launch file path is **/home/ubuntu/puppy_pi/src/lidar_app/launch/**

First, launch the lidar with the following command: `$(find ldlidar)/launch/LD06.launch`. 

Then, start a node named lidar_app, using the lidar.py file from the lidar_app package. The parameters **output="screen"** indicate that the node's output will be displayed in the terminal, while "**respawn='false'**" means that the node will not restart if it unexpectedly terminates.

"**lidar.py**" is the source code file of this program, you can check it in this path "/home/ubuntu/puppy_pi/src/lidar_app/scripts/".

```py
class LidarController:
    def __init__(self, name):
        rospy.init_node(name, anonymous=True,log_level=rospy.DEBUG)
        # rospy.on_shutdown(self.cleanup)
        self.name = name
        self.running_mode = 0 # 1：雷达避障模式 2：雷达警卫模式，(1: Radar obstacle avoidance mode 2: Radar guard mode)
        self.threshold = 0.3 # meters  距离阈值(distance threshold)
        self.scan_angle = math.radians(90)  # radians  向前的扫描角度(the forward scanning angle)
        self.speed = 0.12 # 单位米，避障模式的速度(the speed in meters per second for obstacle avoidance mode)
        self.last_act = 0
