# 23. ROS2_AI Vision and Tracking Course

## 23.1 Color Threshold Adjustment

### 23.1.1 Brief Overview of the Functionality

As we know, different light sources can affect the color of objects, which may lead to variations in color recognition. If these variations impact the functionality, it is necessary to address them.

To solve this issue, this section will guide you through the use of the `LAB_Tool` in the ROS2 environment.

### 23.1.2 Open LAB_Tool

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Click-on <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image2.png" style="width:70px" /> to launch the camera node.

```
ros2 launch peripherals usb_cam.launch.py
```

(3) Execute the following command to navigate to the file lab_tool.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/software/lab_tool
```

(4) Then enter the following command to initiate the PC software.

```
python3 main.py
```

(5) The interface of LAB_Tool is as follow.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image6.png" class="common_img" style="width:700px" />

:::{Note}
If there is not camera returned image, it means that the camera is not connected. Please check the camera wiring.
:::

### 23.1.3 Interface Layout

The interface is divided into two parts, including image display zone and recognition adjustment zone.

| **Area Name** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| Display Area | <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image6.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px" /> |
| Recognition Adjustment Area | <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image16.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px" /> |

* **Display Area**

| **Icon** | **Function Description** |
|----|----|
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image17.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px" /> | The left side shows the original image, while the right side shows the processed image. |

* **Recognition Adjustment Area**

In the Recognition Adjustment Area, users can modify color attributes. The functions of each component are listed below:

| **Icon** | **Function Description** |
|----|----|
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image7.png"  /> | Adjusts the value of the L component in the image. (The A and B sliders function similarly, adjusting their respective components.) |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image18.png"  /> | Selects the target color to be adjusted. |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image8.png"  /> | Saves the current adjustment values. |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image9.png"  /> | Adds a new color type for recognition. |

### 23.1.4 Adjust Default Color

(1) Open the LAB TOOL, and select the color whose threshold needs to be adjusted from the color list in the recognition adjustment area. Here, we will use red as an example.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Set the `min` values for the L, A, and B components to `0` and the `max` values to `255`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

(3) **Point the camera** at the object whose color you want to calibrate. In the **Recognition Adjustment Area**, use the **L**, **A**, and **B** sliders to fine-tune the threshold values. Adjust the sliders until the **target object appears white** in the **left side of the Display Area**, while all other areas appear black. This indicates successful isolation of the target color.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

* **LAB Threshold Adjustment Reference**

| **Component** | **Value Range** | **Color Spectrum** |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| L | 0~255 | Lightness: Black to White（-L ~ +L） |
| A | 0~255 | Green to Red (−A to +A) |
| B | 0~255 | Blue to Yellow（-b ~ +b） |

* **Understanding LAB Color Space**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image13.png" class="common_img" />

When adjusting thresholds, shift the L, A, and B values toward the color range you want to recognize.

For example, to detect red, follow these steps:

① Initialize the range: Set all component ranges (L, A, B) from 0 to 255 by setting the minimum values to 0 and maximum values to 255.

② Focus on the A component: Red is located near the +A region in LAB space. To isolate red:
- Keep the **A_max** value unchanged.
- Gradually increase **A_min** until the target red object appears white in the Display Area, and the background turns black.

③ Fine-tune based on environment:
- If the red appears too light, increase **L_min**.
- If the red appears too dark, decrease **L_max**.
- If the red shifts toward a warm tone, increase **B_min**.
- If it shifts toward a cool tone, decrease **A_max**.

### 23.1.5 Add New Recognition Color

In addition to the three built-in recognizable colors, users can define additional colors for recognition. There are two available methods:

① **Manually modify the LAB values** of an existing default color to match the desired color.
② Use the **Add** button to create a new color entry from scratch.

To ensure ease of use and quick results, this lesson will focus on the first method.

**Follow the steps below to set up orange as a recognizable color:**

(1) Launch the LAB_Tool from the system desktop. After connecting the camera, navigate to the Recognition Adjustment Area and select `red` from the color selection dropdown.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Point the camera at the orange object you want to detect. Adjust the L, A, and B sliders until the area containing the orange object appears white in the left panel of the Display Area, and all other regions appear black.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image15.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Once the desired result is achieved, click the `Save` button in the Recognition Adjustment Area to store the modified LAB values.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_1/media/image16.png" class="common_img" />

## 23.2 Color Recognition

### 23.2.1 Program Overview

In this lesson, we will use OpenCV to recognize red, green, and blue objects, with the recognition results displayed in the feedback image.

Before beginning, make sure to prepare one object in each of the red, green, and blue colors.

### 23.2.2 Program Logic

First, capture the RGB image from the camera and apply resizing and Gaussian blur. Then, convert the image color space from RGB to Lab.

Next, use color thresholds to identify the color of the object within the circle. Afterward, apply a mask to the image (masking involves covering the image, shape, or object with a selected region to hide or reveal specific parts of the image).

Then, process the image using morphological operations, such as opening and closing, to refine the image. Finally, highlight the largest object by drawing a circle around it.

* **Opening operation**: This involves erosion followed by dilation. Its purpose is to remove small objects, smooth the shape boundaries, and not alter the area. It can remove small particle noise and separate objects that are connected.

* **Erosion**: Removes boundary points of objects, causing the boundaries to shrink inward. It can eliminate small objects smaller than the structuring element.

* **Dilation**: Expands boundary points, merging all background points touching the object into the object, causing the boundary to expand outward.

Finally, display the recognition results in the feedback image.

### 23.2.3 Operation Steps

:::{Note}
The input command should be case sensitive. And the key words can be complemented by `Tab` key.
:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image3.png"  /> or press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open command line terminal.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(3) Execute the command below to run the program.

```
ros2 launch example color_detect_demo.launch.py
```

(4) To exit this mode, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If the process does not close successfully on the first attempt, repeat the command until it terminates properly.

### 23.2.4 Program Outcome

:::{Note}
After starting the task, please ensure that there are no other objects with recognizable colors within the camera's field of view to avoid affecting the outcome of the task.
:::

After starting the task, place the target object within the camera's field of view. Once the target object is recognized, it will be highlighted with a circle of the corresponding color, and the color name will be displayed at the bottom left of the window. The program can recognize objects in `red`, `blue`, and `green` colors.

### 23.2.5 Program Analysis

[Source Code]()

The source code of this program is located in: [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/example/example/opencv_course/color_detect_demo.py]()

* **Basic Configuration**

* **Read the color threshold settings file**

Use the `get_yaml_data` function to obtain the color threshold configuration file.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

* **Get the image feed**

Create a subscription to the camera feed by using the following code: `node.create_subscription(Image, 'image_raw', image_callback, 1)` This subscribes to the camera feed and retrieves the real-time video stream.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

* **Image Processing**

The `color_detect()` function is mainly invoked to process the image.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

* **Gaussian filtering**

Apply Gaussian blur to the image using the `GaussianBlur()` function from the cv2 library to remove noise from the image.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

The first parameter `frame_resize` is the input image

The second parameter `(3, 3)` is the size of Gaussian kernel

The third parameter `3` is the allowable variance around the average in Gaussian filtering. The larger the value, the larger the allowable variance

* **Color Space Conversion**

Convert the image from the BGR color space to the LAB color space.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

* **Color Detection and Morphological Operations**

Perform erosion and dilation on the image to smooth the edges of contours, making it easier to identify the target contours in subsequent steps.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

- `frame_mask`: The input binary image mask.
- `cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3, 3))`: Generates a 3x3 rectangular structuring element (kernel). This matrix defines the shape and size of the erosion operation. `cv2.MORPH_RECT` specifies a rectangular shape.
- `eroded`: The binary image mask after the erosion operation.
- `cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3, 3))`: Uses the same structuring element as in the erosion step for the dilation operation.

* **Acquire the Maximum Area Contour**

Use the `findContours()` function from the cv2 library to identify the largest contour of the target color in the image.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

① Initialization: `contour_area_temp` and `contour_area_max` are used to store the area of the current contour and the maximum contour, respectively. `area_max_contour` is used to store the contour with the maximum area.

② Iterate through contours: Loop through each contour c in the contours list.

③ Calculate area: Use `cv2.contourArea(c)` to calculate the area of contour c.

④ Determine the maximum area: If the area of the current contour is greater than the known maximum area and exceeds the threshold of 50, update the maximum area and the corresponding contour.

⑤ Return values: The function returns the contour with the largest area, `area_max_contour`, and its corresponding maximum area, `contour_area_max`.

* **Feedback information**

* **Highlight the Target Object**

Use the `drawContours` function to outline the target object in the returned image.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_2/media/image13.png" class="common_img" />

Explanation of the function parameters:

① `img`: The target image where the text will be drawn.
② `"Color: " + detect_color`: The text string to be displayed, showing the detected color.
③ `(10, img.shape[0] - 10)`: The starting position of the text in pixels, representing the bottom-left corner of the text.
④ `10`: The x-coordinate of the text, starting 10 pixels from the left edge.
⑤ `img.shape[0] - 10`: The y-coordinate, positioned 10 pixels above the bottom of the image.
⑥ `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX`: The font type used for the text.
⑦ `0.65`: The font size of the text.
⑧ `draw_color`: The color of the text, specified as a BGR tuple. For example, `(255, 0, 0)` represents blue.
⑨ Line thickness: Specifies the thickness of the text outline in pixels.

### 23.2.6 Feature Extension

`coordinate` represents the tag coordinate, `tag_family` refers to the type of tag, and `tag_id` indicates tag ID.

* **3D Image Rendering**

* **Relative Pose Calculation**

To render a 3D image at a specific position in the returned view, the pose of the camera relative to the world coordinate system must first be calculated. This involves determining the rotation vector and translation vector for transforming from the world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system using the `cv2.solvePnP()` function.

{lineno-start=}
```python

```
<img src="../_static/media/chapter_23/section_4/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

The parameters in parentheses have the following meanings:
