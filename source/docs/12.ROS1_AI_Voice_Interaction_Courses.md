### 12.1.7 Firmware Development

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create and flash firmware for the WonderEcho Pro module.

* **Firmware Creation and Flashing**

:::{Note}
We'll use **HIWONDER** as an example to demonstrate the firmware creation process. The same procedure also applies to creating firmware with Chinese wake words. Note: English wake words must be entered in all uppercase letters to function properly.
:::

(1) Open the official firmware creation website: [https://aiplatform.chipintelli.com/home/index.html](); The platform interface is in Chinese. If needed, use your browser's translation feature to switch to English for easier navigation.

(2) First, visit the ChipIntelli Voice AI Platform by clicking on Platform Features in the top menu, and then select In-depth development of Product Firmware & SDK under the Product Development section.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image2.png" class="common_img" />

(3) You will be prompted to log in. (Note: Currently, registration is only available for mainland China mobile numbers. For international users, we provide a shared account:
Username: 18033085495
Password: hiwonder

After successfully logging in, click **In-depth development of Product Firmware & SDK** again to access the development section.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(4) To create a new product, click the option in the left sidebar. You will be asked to provide a Product Name and a Description, both of which can be customized. For the other fields, follow the options shown in the red box. Specifically, choose Product Type: **通用 (General)** → **智能中控 (Smart Central Control)**. After completing these steps, click Create.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image4.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Next, you will need to set the project language. Since we are configuring for English voice recognition, select English under Language Type. If you were configuring for Chinese recognition, you would select Chinese for both Voice Type and Acoustic Model. Once you've selected the appropriate options, click Continue to proceed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

(6) In the firmware configuration interface, you will make some important changes to the settings. Start by enabling the Echo Cancellation feature under Algorithm Settings.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(7) Under Hardware Settings, set the oscillator source to Internal RC and disable the Baud Rate Calibration function.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image13.png" class="common_img" />

(8) In the UART Print Settings, configure UART1 to Open-Drain Mode, supporting external 5V pull-up.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image14.png" class="common_img" />

(9) For Communication UART Settings, set the Baud Rate to 115200 and configure UART0 to Open-Drain Mode, also supporting external 5V pull-up. After adjusting these settings, click Continue to move forward.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image15.png" class="common_img" />

(10) The next step involves configuring the command words. You will need to choose a voice output for the wake-up command. For this example, select **Dane – English Male Voice** as the output voice. (If you're using Chinese as the language, you may choose the voice option **Chengcheng – Standard Boy Ver.1**. The selection between Chinese and English voices is determined by the language settings configured in Step 5.)

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image16.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image17.png" class="common_img" />

(11) Next, upload the command word configuration file. Navigate to the folder [Wake Word Protocol List]() and locate the spreadsheet titled **Command Phrase and Playback Protocol List V3 – English Template**. Simply drag and drop the file into the upload area on the webpage.

:::{Note}
If you wish to change the wake word, open the spreadsheet and replace the default wake word HIWONDER with your preferred word. Keep in mind that the English version of the firmware only supports English wake words, and mixed-language wake words are not allowed. Additionally, English wake words must be written in uppercase letters to function properly.
:::

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image18.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image19.png" class="common_img" />

(12) After uploading the file, you will see the command data populated in the table below.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/04/media/image20.png" class="common_img" />

(13) Click **Submit** and wait a few minutes for the firmware generation process to complete. Once finished, click **Download** to obtain your customized firmware.

## 12.2 Voice Recognition

### 12.2.1 Preparation

Refer to [12.1 Introduction to WonderEcho Pro and Installation]() to flash the firmware onto the WonderEcho Pro module. Once the firmware has been successfully burned, install the module onto the robot.

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is **Hello, HiWonder**. If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi`, please refer to the tutorial titled [12.1.6Firmware Flashing Method]() for step-by-step instructions.

### 12.2.2 Brief Game Instructions

The program receives data from the the WonderEcho Pro through the serial port and changes the RGB LED colors according to the recognized voice commands.

### 12.2.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}
When entering commands, ensure that case sensitivity is strictly followed. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.
:::

(1) Power on the robot and remotely connect to the Raspberry Pi desktop via VNC.

(2) On the Raspberry Pi desktop, double-click the `Terminator` icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/media/image3.png" /> to open the command-line terminal and enter the ROS1 development environment.

(3) Execute the following command to disable the app service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Type the command and press Enter to start the low-level control node.

```
roslaunch ros_robot_controller ros_robot_controller_node.launch
```

(5) Open a new terminal window, enter the following command, and press Enter to switch to the directory where the program is located.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/puppypi/src/puppy_extend_demo/scripts
```

(6) Enter the following command and press Enter to initiate the program:

```
python3 ASR_detect_demo.py
```

(7) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If the command does not stop the program, please try again.

(8) Click the icon in the top-left corner of the Raspberry Pi desktop to open the terminal. Next, enter the command and press Enter to enable the mobile app's auto-start service.

```

```

### 12.2.4 How It Works

:::{Note}
The wake-up commands vary depending on the firmware installed. If you are using the Chinese Xiaohuan Xiaohuan firmware, please use the Chinese commands below. For PuppyPi or Hello HiWonder firmware, use the English commands provided.
:::

| **User Command** | **Terminal print** | **Actions** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| puppypi | AA 55 03 00 FB |  |
| RED-LIGHT | AA 55 00 8A FB | Red light on |
| GREEN-LIGHT | AA 55 00 8B FB | Green light on |
| BLUE-LIGHT | AA 55 00 8C FB | Blue light on |
| TURN-OFF-THE-LIGHT | AA 55 00 09 FB | Turn off the light |

:::{Note}
Once the program is running, simply say **Puppy** to activate voice recognition. After activation, you can control the RGB LED on the Raspberry Pi expansion board by speaking color commands—for example, saying **red light** will change the LED to red, while **green light** or **blue light** will switch it to green or blue, respectively. If there's no voice input for over 15 seconds, the system will automatically enter sleep mode. To wake it up, just say **PuppyPi** again.

```python
def get_mp3_files(directory):
    """Read all MP3 files from the directory.（从目录中读取所有 MP3 文件）"""
    files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith(".mp3")]
    return {i + 1: os.path.join(directory, f) for i, f in enumerate(files)}
```

Retrieve all MP3 files from the specified directory and save their file paths in a dictionary.

* **Play the Audio**

{lineno-start=38}
```python
def play_audio(file_path):

    global mpg123_process
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):

    # Move forward.（向前走）
    PuppyVelocityPub.publish(x=5, y=0, yaw_rate=0)
    rospy.sleep(3)
    PuppyVelocityPub.publish(x=0, y=0, yaw_rate=0)

    # Move backward.（向后走）
    rospy.sleep(1)
    PuppyVelocityPub.publish(x=-5, y=0, yaw_rate=0)
    rospy.sleep(3)
    PuppyVelocityPub.publish(x=0, y=0, yaw_rate=0)

    # Sliding motion group.（滑步动作组）
    runActionGroup_srv('moonwalk.d6ac', True)
    rospy.sleep(0.5)
```

It can control the robotic dog to carry out basic actions like standing, marching in place, multi-axis coordination, moving forward, and moving backward, as well as execute predefined action sequences such as the moonwalk.

### 12.3.7 Function Expansion

* **Modifying Dance Movements**

## 12.4 Voice Interaction

### 12.4.1 Preparation

Refer to [12.1 Introduction to WonderEcho Pro and Installation]() to flash the firmware onto the WonderEcho Pro module. Once the firmware has been successfully burned, install the module onto the robot.

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is **Hello, HiWonder**. If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi`, please refer to the tutorial titled [12.1.6Firmware Flashing Method]() for step-by-step instructions.

### 12.4.2 Brief Game Instructions

This program receives commands through the serial port, processes them, and controls the robotic dog to perform the corresponding actions. Leveraging the ROS framework, it manages the robot's posture, gait, and speed, while enabling voice interaction by accepting external commands via serial communication.

### 12.4.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}
When entering commands, ensure that case sensitivity is strictly followed. You can use the Tab key to auto-complete keywords.
:::

(1) Power on the robot and remotely connect to the Raspberry Pi desktop via VNC.

(2) On the Raspberry Pi desktop, double-click the `Terminator` icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image3.png" style="width:70px" /> to open the command-line terminal and enter the ROS1 development environment.

(3) Execute the following command to disable the app service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Type the command and press Enter to start the motion control node.

```
roslaunch puppy_control puppy_control.launch
```

(5) Open a new terminal window, enter the following command, and press Enter to switch to the directory where the program is located.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/puppypi/src/puppy_extend_demo/scripts
```

(6) Enter the following command and press Enter to initiate the program:

```
python3 voice_interaction_demo.py
```

(7) To exit this feature, simply press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal. If the command does not stop the program, please try again.

(8) Click the icon in the top-left corner of the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_4/media/image9.png" style="width:70px" /> to open the terminal. Next, enter the command and press Enter to enable the mobile app's auto-start service.

```
sudo systemctl restart start_node.service
```

### 12.4.4 How It Works

:::{Note}
The wake-up commands vary depending on the firmware installed. If you are using the Chinese Xiaohuan Xiaohuan firmware, please use the Chinese commands below. For PuppyPi or Hello HiWonder firmware, use the English commands provided.
:::

| **User Command** | **Terminal print** | **Actions** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| puppypi | AA 55 03 00 FB |  |
| STAND-STILL | AA 55 00 76 FB | March on the spot |
| LOOK-UP | AA 55 00 8D FB | Look up |
| GET-DOWN | AA 55 00 0B FB | Lie down |
| TATTENTION | AA 55 00 0A FB | Stand at attention |

:::{Note}
Once the program is running, the robotic dog will stay in a standing position. To activate voice control, simply say **PuppyPi** After activation, you can issue various voice commands—for example, say **LOOK-UP** and the dog will lift its head, **GET-DOWN** to switch to a resting posture, **ATTENTION** to return to standing, or **STAND-STILL** to start stepping on the spot. If no commands are received for over 15 seconds, the system will automatically enter sleep mode. Just say **PuppyPi** again to wake it up.
