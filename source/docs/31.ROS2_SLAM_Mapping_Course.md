# 31. ROS2-SLAM Mapping Course

## 31.1 SLAM Mapping Principle

### 31.1.1 SLAM Introduction

Before starting the journey, both humans and robots need to know their current location. However, the way they do it differs. Humans use their eyes, while robots use Lidar sensors.

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) comprises two processes: localization and mapping. Localization determines the robot's position in the coordinate system. The origin of the coordinate system and the robot's pose can be determined using the first keyframe, the existing global map, road sign points, and GPS.

Mapping involves creating a map of the robot's surroundings. The primary geometric element of this map is a point. Navigation involves two parts: global planning/local planning and the control of the robot's movements.

### 31.1.2 Mapping Principle

Mapping contains three main processes:

(1) Preprocessing: optimize the original point cloud data of Lidar by removing any wrong data and filtering it.

The point cloud is a collection of surrounding information acquired by Lidar. It contains a series of accurate angle and distance information for objects in the surroundings, but it may also include some irrelevant or inaccurate data.

(2) Matching: find the position on the map that corresponds to the point cloud data collected in a local area.

The laser SLAM system compares two point clouds collected at different times and calculates the change in distance and pose of the Lidar to locate the robot.

(3) Map integration: integrate the latest data received by Lidar into the existing map to update it.

Lidar uses a pulse laser as the signal source to scan the surrounding obstacles and gather information about the target points. The scattered laser will then be reflected on the receiver of Lidar, enabling it to calculate the distance from the target points. By scanning the target points, the Lidar can gather data for all points and create a 3D image through processing.

### 31.1.3 Mapping Skill

\(1\) Place the robot in front of a wall or a box before enabling mapping, which allows the robot to scan more points.

\(2\) Try to keep the robot moving straight instead of turning to avoid sparse feature point collection by the Lidar. When the features in the environment are weak, it's best to map areas where feature points are obvious to improve accuracy.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media\chapter_31\section_1\media\image4.png" style="width:3.11528in;height:3.27569in" />

(3) To map large environments effectively, it's recommended that the robot completes the mapping loop first and then focuses on scanning smaller details in the environment.

In environments like shopping malls, which have a lot of transparent glass and unclear environmental features, it's helpful to stop the robot at a suitable location if there are distinct features ahead, such as columns, left and right passages, or diagonal walls. The robot can then rotate in place towards the feature position and wait until the Lidar has scanned the feature environment before rotating back and continuing forward. However, it's best to avoid backing up during the rotation process to ensure accurate mapping.

### 31.1.4 Evaluation of Map Building Results

After the map construction is completed, the following points can be used to determine if the results meet the navigation requirements:

(1) Whether the edges of obstacles in them map are clear.

(2) Whether there are areas in the map that do not match the actual environment (e.g. loop closures).

\(3\) Whether there are gray areas within the robot's operational area in the map (e.g. unscanned areas).

\(4\) Whether there are obstacles in the map that will not exist during subsequent localization (e.g. moving obstacles).

\(5\) Whether the map ensures that the robot has explored every position within its operational area, with a 360-degree field of view.

## 31.2 slam_toolbox Mapping Algorithm

### 31.2.1 Algorithm Definition

Slam Toolbox is a software package for 2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) that processes LaserScan messages from a laser rangefinder to create 2D maps of the environment. It utilizes **TF transforms** between the  **odom**  and **base_link** frames to align sensor data. The package supports saving and reloading serialized SLAM maps and pose graphs for tasks like continuous mapping, localization, merging maps, and other operations.

Slam Toolbox operates in two modes:

(1) Synchronous mode: Processes all valid sensor measurements regardless of delays.

(2) Asynchronous mode: Processes valid sensor measurements whenever possible, without waiting for full synchronization.

This package serves as a robust alternative to tools like **gmapping, cartographer, karto, and hector,** offering a complete SLAM solution. It is built on Karto's powerful scan matcher, widely used and optimized for this application. Additionally, it introduces:

A new optimization plugin based on **Google Ceres**.

A novel localization method called **Elastic Pose-Graph Localization**, which uses a sliding measurement window added to the graph for optimization and refinement. This method enables tracking of changes in local features of the environment without treating them as errors. When leaving a specific area, redundant nodes are removed to avoid affecting the long-term map.

Slam Toolbox is a comprehensive suite of tools for 2D SLAM with key features including:

- Mapping and Saving: Generate maps and save them as **.pgm** files.

- Map Refinement and Updates: Refine existing maps, remap, or continue mapping on a previously saved map.

- Long-Term Mapping: Load a saved map to continue mapping while removing irrelevant information from new laser point clouds.

- Optimized Localization Mode: Improve localization on an existing map, or run in "Lidar Odometry" mode for localization without mapping.

- Synchronous and Asynchronous Mapping: Supports both mapping modes.

- Dynamic Map Merging: Merge maps dynamically during operation.

- Plugin-Based Optimization Solvers: Includes a new optimization plugin based on Google Ceres.

- Interactive RViz Plugin: Provides interactive features in RViz for visualization.

- Graphical Tools in RViz: Offers tools for manipulating nodes and connections during mapping.

- Map Serialization and Lossless Data Storage: Enables saving maps with complete data integrity.

* **KARTO：**

Karto_SLAM is a graph-based SLAM approach that uses sparse system decoupling as its solution, leveraging highly optimized, non-iterative Cholesky decomposition. In this method, graph optimization represents the map as a graph where each node corresponds to a position in the robot's trajectory and its associated sensor measurements. Each time a new node is added, the graph is updated through computation.

The ROS version of Karto_SLAM incorporates Sparse Pose Adjustment (SPA), which is closely tied to scan matching and loop closure detection. While increasing the number of landmarks requires more memory, graph optimization offers significant advantages in large-scale mapping. This is because it focuses only on the robot's poses in the graph, optimizing the trajectory before reconstructing the map.

The algorithmic framework of Karto_SLAM is outlined as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_31/section_2/media/image2.png" style="width:4.49722in;height:4.54167in" />

From the diagram, it is evident that the process is relatively straightforward. Karto_SLAM follows the traditional soft real-time SLAM mechanism: each incoming frame of data is processed sequentially, with results returned immediately.

(5) When using the controller to move the robot dog for mapping, it is recommended to reduce the robot's speed. The lower the robot's speed, the smaller the odometry error, resulting in better mapping accuracy. As the robot dog moves, the map displayed in RViz will continuously update and expand until the entire environment is mapped.
