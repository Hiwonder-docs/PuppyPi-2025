* **Overview of Large Language Model**

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced artificial intelligence model developed to comprehend and generate human language.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.1\01\media\image2.png"  />

(1) Basic Concept

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on extensive text data, designed to either generate natural language text or comprehend the meaning of language. LLM is capable of performing various natural language tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and dialogue, making them a crucial step toward achieving advanced artificial intelligence. Unlike smaller models, LLM leverages a similar Transformer architecture and pretraining objectives (like Language Modeling), but are distinguished by their larger model size, greater training data, and enhanced computational resources.

(2) Features

**Massive Scale:** LLM are characterized by their vast parameter sizes, often reaching billions or even trillions of parameters. This immense scale allows them to capture a wealth of linguistic knowledge and complex syntactic structures.

**Pretraining and Fine-tuning:** LLM utilize a two-stage learning process: pretraining and fine-tuning. Initially, they are pretrained on large-scale, unlabeled text data, learning general language representations and knowledge. Subsequently, they are fine-tuned using labeled data to specialize in specific tasks, allowing them to excel across a wide range of NLP applications.

**Contextual Awareness:** LLM demonstrate exceptional contextual awareness, with their ability to understand and generate language deeply dependent on preceding text. This enables them to perform exceptionally well in tasks like dialogue, article generation, and contextual comprehension.

**Multilingual Capabilities:** LLM support multiple languages, extending beyond just English. This multilingual proficiency enables them to power cross-lingual and cross-cultural applications, enhancing their versatility and global reach.

**Multimodal Support:** Some LLMs have expanded to handle multimodal data, including text, images, and speech. This capability allows them to understand and generate content across various media types, opening up more diverse application possibilities.

**Emergent Properties:** LLM exhibit remarkable emergent properties, where performance improvements become apparent in large models but are absent in smaller ones. This makes them adept at handling more complex tasks and challenges.

**Cross-domain Applications:** LLM have been widely adopted across numerous fields, including text generation, machine translation, information retrieval, summarization, chatbots, and virtual assistants. Their influence is profound, impacting both daily life and work in significant ways.

**Ethical and Risk Considerations:** While LLM showcase impressive capabilities, they also raise important ethical and risk-related concerns, such as the potential generation of harmful content, privacy violations, and cognitive biases. As such, the development and deployment of LLM must be approached with careful consideration and caution.

(3) Working Principle

Large Language Model (LLM) are built on deep learning principles and are trained using massive datasets and substantial computational resources to develop neural networks with billions of parameters. Through iterative training and parameter optimization, these models learn to perform a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. The “large” in LLM reflects their immense scale—encompassing a vast number of parameters, extensive training data, and significant computational demands. This scale enables advanced models to achieve superior generalization capabilities and deliver increasingly accurate results, even in highly specialized domains.

Today, some of the most popular applications revolve around generative AI, such as language generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and image generation platforms (e.g., Midjourney). At the core of these applications is the concept of generation—the model’s ability to predict and produce coherent content based on a given input.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Text Generation

Large Language Models are capable of generating diverse types of text, including news articles, stories, poems, and more. These capabilities make them well-suited for applications in content creation, creative writing, and automated storytelling.

② Text Classification

Large Language Models can classify text into various categories, such as sentiment analysis and topic identification. These capabilities are especially valuable in scenarios like public opinion analysis, information retrieval, and content moderation.

③  Machine Translation

Large Language Models excel at machine translation, enabling the conversion of text from one language to another. These capabilities are essential for cross-language communication, localization, and global collaboration.

④ Question-Answering Systems

Large Language Models can be used to build question-answering systems that respond to user queries. These applications are particularly valuable in areas such as intelligent customer support, knowledge retrieval, and information lookup.

### 34.1.2 Large Speech Model Courses

* **Overview of Large Speech Model**

(1) What is a Large Speech Model?

A Speech Large Model (LSM) refers to a machine learning model that uses deep learning techniques to process and understand speech data. These models can be applied in a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, and emotional analysis of speech. The design and training of these models typically require large amounts of speech data and substantial computational resources, which is why they are referred to as "large models."

(2) Why Do We Need Large Speech Model?

With the advancement of artificial intelligence and deep learning, traditional speech processing methods face many limitations. Large models leverage vast amounts of data and deep neural networks to learn and understand the complex features within speech, thereby improving the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and generation.

Their advantages include:

① High Accuracy: They maintain a high recognition rate even in noisy environments and with various accents.

② Naturalness: Speech generated by synthesis models is more natural, closely resembling human speech.

③ Versatility: These models support a wide range of languages and tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and emotion recognition.

(3) Development of Speech Recognition Technology

Word-Level Speech Recognition: At this stage, speech recognition systems could only recognize individual words

Phrase-Level Speech Recognition: With the expansion of data and advancements in algorithms, speech recognition systems gradually gained the ability to recognize longer phrases, such as "Please turn on my computer."

Sentence-Level Speech Recognition: In recent years, with the emergence of AI large models, speech recognition systems have become capable of recognizing entire sentences and understanding their underlying meaning.

(4) Differences Between Large Speech Model and Traditional Speech Processing Technologies

① Processing Methods

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically rely on manual feature extraction and shallow models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to process speech signals.

Large Speech Model: These use end-to-end learning, directly mapping raw speech waveforms to target outputs (such as text or another speech signal), reducing the reliance on manual feature extraction. They are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers.

② Model Complexity

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These models are relatively simple, with fewer parameters.

Large Speech Model: These models have complex structures and a large number of parameters, enabling them to capture more subtle speech features and contextual information.

③ Recognition Capability

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These are highly adaptable to specific scenarios and conditions, but their recognition capability is limited when encountering new, unseen data.

Large Speech Model: Due to their large number of parameters and powerful learning ability, they offer superior recognition capabilities and can adapt to a wider variety of speech data and environments.

④Training Data Requirements

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically require less data for training, but the data must be highly annotated and of high quality.

Large Speech Model: These require vast amounts of training data to fully learn the complexities of speech, often necessitating large quantities of annotated data or the use of unsupervised/self-supervised learning methods.

(5) Core Technologies of Speech Large Model

① Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

ASR is the technology that converts human speech into text. The core steps of a speech recognition system include feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and language modeling.

② Text-to-Speech (TTS)

TTS is the technology that converts text into speech. Common speech synthesis models include the Tacotron series, FastSpeech, and VITS.

③ Speech Enhancement and Noise Reduction

Speech enhancement techniques are used to improve the quality of speech signals, typically for eliminating background noise and echoes. This is crucial for speech recognition applications in noisy environments.

(6) Applications of Speech Large Model

① Connection Illustration and Detection

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2\02\media\image3.png"   />

If the main controller is a Raspberry Pi, you can use VNC remote desktop access (refer to the appendix: Remote Access and File Transfer) to log into the Raspberry Pi system. Once connected, check the upper right corner of the desktop for microphone and speaker icons. As shown in the image below, the presence of these icons indicates a successful connection.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2\02\media\image4.png"  />

If you're using a NVIDIA Jetson device, you can connect via the NoMachine remote access tool. After logging in, check the upper right corner of the system interface for the speaker icon to confirm successful detection.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2\02\media\image5.png"  />

② Recording Test

Next, open a new terminal window and enter the following command to check the available recording devices. Note that the -l option is a lowercase "**L**". You should see the card number (card) listed—for example, card 0. This is just an example; please refer to your actual query result.

```
arecord -l
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2\02\media\image6.png"  />

Then, use the following command to start recording. Replace the red-marked card number (hw:0,0) with the actual number you found in the previous step:

```
arecord -D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 2 test.wav
```

This will create a test.wav audio file in the current directory.

You can record a short 5-second sample, then press Ctrl + C to stop the recording.

③ Playback Test

After the recording is complete, you can check whether the audio file was successfully created by listing the contents of the current directory:

```
ls
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2\02\media\image8.png"  />

If test.wav appears in the list, the recording was successful. To play back the recording, use the following command:

```
aplay test.wav
```

* **Voice Wake-Up**

In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use a large speech model to activate the voice device by speaking a predefined wake word through a program.

(1) WonderEcho Pro Wake-Up

Device Check：

To proceed, we need to identify the USB device name assigned to the connected WonderEcho Pro or Circular Microphone Array (hereafter referred to as the voice device). Please follow the steps below carefully. 

:::{Note}

Do not connect any other USB devices during this process to avoid confusion.

:::

① First, disconnect the voice device, then open a terminal and run the following command:

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

② Next, reconnect the voice device to the USB port on your main board and run the same command again:

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

③ You should now see a newly listed USB port, such as ttyCH341USB1.  

Please take note of this device name—it may vary depending on the main controller being used.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/03/media/image3.png"  />

Wake-Up Test：

① To begin, update the port number used in the program by editing the script. You’ll also need to uncomment the line for the port you're using and comment out any unused ports.

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

Press i to enter edit mode and make the necessary changes as shown below (update the port number accordingly and adjust comments as needed).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/03/media/image4.png"  />

Once the changes are complete, press ESC, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit the editor.

② Next, return to the system interface and run the wake-up demo using the command below. Speak the wake word **“HELLO HIWONDER”** clearly toward the WonderEcho Pro voice device.  

If the output includes **“keyword detect”**, it indicates that the firmware has been successfully flashed and the wake word is functioning correctly.

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/03/media/image5.png"  />

(2) 6-Microphone Circular Array

As with the WonderEcho Pro, you can connect the 6-Microphone Circular Array to your main board (Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson) using a Type-C to USB cable.

Device Check:

For Jetson users, connect to the Jetson system using the NoMachine remote access tool. Once connected, check the desktop interface.  

If the 6-Microphone Circular Array icon appears on the left side of the desktop, it indicates the device has been successfully recognized.

Wake-Up Test:

① Open a new terminal window and run the following command to edit the wakeup_demo.py script:

```
vim ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press i to enter edit mode.

③ Update the port to match the device port number you previously identified. Comment out the WonderEcho Pro configuration (add \# at the beginning of the corresponding line), and uncomment the line using the circular microphone array on line 11 as the input device (see red box in the referenced image).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/03/media/image7.png"  />

④ Press ESC to return to command mode, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/03/media/image8.png"  />

⑤ In the terminal, run the wake-up program with the following command:

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

⑥ After about 30 seconds of initialization, speak the wake word **“hello hiwonder”** to test the device.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/03/media/image10.png"  />

(3) Brief Program Overview

This is a Python-based wake word detection script that utilizes the speech module to process audio input and detect a specific wake word (e.g., "**HELLO_HIWONDER**").

Source Code Path: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/wakeup_demo.py]()

Importing Required Modules

{lineno-start=5}

```
import os
import time
from speech import awake
```

`os`: Used for handling file paths and executing system-level commands.

`time`: Provides delay functions to prevent overly frequent detection attempts.

`speech`: The core module responsible for processing audio input and detecting the wake word.

Initializing the wonderecho Class

{lineno-start=9}

```
port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
kws = awake.WonderEchoPro(port)
```

Attempts to Turn Off the Cooling Fan on Raspberry Pi 5

{lineno-start=13}

```
try:  # If a fan is present, it's recommended to turn it off before detection to reduce interference(如果有风扇，检测前推荐关掉减少干扰)
    os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh')
except:
    pass
```

Purpose: Attempts to turn off the cooling fan by executing the system command `pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh`. This helps minimize background noise from the fan that could interfere with wake word detection.

Error Handling: If the command fails (e.g., due to unsupported hardware), the program catches the exception and continues running without interruption.

Main Wake Word Detection Loop

{lineno-start=18}

```
kws.start() # Start detection(开始检测)
print('start...')
```

The program starts the wake word detection thread using kws.start().

It prints start... to indicate that detection has been successfully initiated.

Main Program Logic

{lineno-start=20}

```
while True:
    try:
        if kws.wakeup(): # Wake-up detected(检测到唤醒)
            print('hello hiwonder')
        time.sleep(0.02)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        kws.exit() # Cancel processing (关闭处理)
        try:
            os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
        except:
            pass
        break
```

During each iteration, the program checks whether the wake word has been detected. If the wake word is detected, it prints keyword detected.

The detection frequency is controlled using time.sleep(0.02) to prevent excessive CPU usage.

Pressing Ctrl+C triggers a KeyboardInterrupt, which gracefully exits the detection loop.

Upon exit, the program calls kws.exit() to stop the wake word detection process.

The fan is then restored to its original state (if applicable).

(4) Extended Functionality

Modifying the Wake-Up Response Text

In this section, you'll learn how to change the message that appears after a successful wake word detection.

① For example, if the wake word "HELLO_HIWONDER" is detected, and you'd like the program to print "hello" instead of the default message, follow the steps below. Navigate to the large_models directory and open the script with:

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press i to enter INSERT mode (you’ll see -- INSERT -- at the bottom of the screen). Locate the line ‘**print('hello hiwonder')**’, and modify it to ‘print('hello')’

```
i
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2\05\media\image5.png"  />

(6) Brief Program Analysis

This program is a speech synthesis system based on OpenAI’s Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, capable of converting text into audio files. It supports input text and outputs audio in formats like PCM, WAV, FLAC, AAC, Opus, and MP3. By specifying the desired text, the program sends the request to the API and returns the synthesized audio, which can be played or saved locally.

The source code for this program is located at:  [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_tts_demo.py]()

① Module Import

{lineno-start=5}

```
from config import *
from speech import speech  
```

speech: This module encapsulates the TTS functionalities.

② Definition for TTS Class

{lineno-start=8}

```
tts = speech.RealTimeOpenAITTS()
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?") # https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?", model="tts-1", voice="onyx", speed=1.0, instructions='Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.')
tts.save_audio("Hello, Can I help you?", model="gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="onyx", speed=1.0, instructions='Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.', audio_format='wav', save_path="./resources/audio/tts_audio.wav")
```

`speed`: Specifies the playback speed; the default value is 1.

Once the program starts, the speaker will play the synthesized audio using the newly selected voice style.

* **Voice Interaction**

(1) What is Voice Interaction?

Voice Interaction (VI) refers to a method of communication between humans and computers or devices through spoken language. It integrates speech recognition and speech synthesis, enabling devices to both understand user commands and respond naturally, creating true two-way voice communication. To achieve natural voice interaction, factors such as semantic understanding and sentiment analysis must also be considered, allowing the system to accurately interpret user intent and provide appropriate responses.

This approach can be used as the foundation for developing our own AI assistant features.

(2) How It Works

First, the wake word detection module listens for a specific wake-up word. Once detected, it initiates audio recording. After recording, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts the audio into text, which is then sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an appropriate response. The generated text is subsequently converted into speech through a Text-to-Speech (TTS) module and played back to the user. This entire process enables seamless and natural interaction between the user and the voice assistant.

(3) Experiment Steps

① Power on the device and connect to it via MobaXterm (refer to Appendix "5.1 Remote Connection Tools and Instructions" for connection guidance).

② To check the microphone's port number, first disconnect the microphone and run the command. Then reconnect the microphone and run the command again to determine the port number (Note: do not connect any other USB devices during this process).

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

After disconnecting the microphone, no USB device should appear.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/06/media/image2.png"  />

Upon reconnecting the microphone, a USB port (e.g., ttyCH341USB1) will be listed (make sure to note this device name). The device name may vary depending on the main controller.

③ Navigate to the program directory:

```
cd large_models/
```

④ Open the configuration file to enter your API Key. After editing, press Esc, then type :wq and hit Enter to save and exit:

```
vim config.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/06/media/image4.png"  />

⑤ Enter the port number you obtained and modify the corresponding microphone port settings for either WonderEcho Pro or the six-microphone setup. Uncomment the configuration for the port you intend to use and comment out the settings for any unused ports.

```
vim openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

If you are using the WonderEcho Pro, modify the corresponding section:

If you are using the 6-Microphone Array, modify the relevant section:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/06/media/image5.png"  />

⑥ Run the program:

```
python3 openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

⑦ To stop the program at any time, simply press Ctrl+C.

(4) Function Realization

After successful execution, the voice device will announce 'I’m ready.' Then, upon hearing the wake-up word 'HELLO_HIWONDER,' the device will respond with 'I’m here,' indicating that the assistant has been successfully awakened. You can now ask the AI assistant any questions:

For example: 'What are some fun places to visit in New York?'

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_1.2/06/media/image7.png"  />

(5) Brief Program Analysis

The program integrates voice recognition, speech synthesis, and intelligent response functionalities to create a voice assistant. Interaction is initiated through the wake-up word (HELLO_HIWONDER). Users can converse with the assistant via voice commands, and the assistant will respond using text-to-speech technology. The overall structure is clear, with distinct modules that are easy to expand and maintain.

The source code for this program is located at: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_interaction_demo.py]()

(1) Module Import

{lineno-start=5}

```
import os
import time
from config import *
from speech import awake

```

This section configures the audio file paths used by various functional modules, such as wake-up sounds, recording storage paths, and prompt sounds.

The text-to-speech (TTS) module is initialized to convert LLM responses into speech.

(3) Main Functional Logic

{lineno-start=33}

```
def main():
    kws.start()
    while True:
        try:
            if kws.wakeup(): # Wake word detected(检测到唤醒词)
                speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)  # Play wake-up sound(唤醒播放)
                asr_result = asr.asr() # Start voice recognition(开启录音识别)
                print('asr_result:', asr_result)
                if asr_result:
                    # Send the recognition result to the agent for a response(将识别结果传给智能体让他来回答)
                    response = client.llm(asr_result, model='gpt-4o-mini')
                    print('llm response:', response)
                    tts.tts(response)
                else:
                    speech.play_audio(no_voice_audio_path)
            time.sleep(0.02)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            kws.exit() 
            try:
                os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
            except:
                pass
            break
        except BaseException as e:
            print(e)
```

Wake-up Detection: Continuously monitors for the wake-up word. Once detected, it stops the wake-up detection and plays the wake-up prompt sound.

Voice Processing: Records and recognizes the user's speech, uses the language model to generate a response, and then converts the response into speech for playback.

Error Handling: Catches exit signals and runtime errors to ensure the program exits safely and releases resources.

### 34.1.3 Vision Language Model Courses

* **Overview of Vision Language Model**

Vision Language Model (VLM) integrate visual recognition capabilities into traditional Language Model (LLM), enabling more powerful interactions between vision and language through multimodal inputs.

(1) Basic Concept

Vision Language Model (VLM) are a type of artificial intelligence model that leverages deep learning techniques to learn from and process large-scale visual data. These models often adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling them to extract rich visual features from images or video streams and perform various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. In theory, VLM possess powerful capabilities in feature extraction and pattern recognition, making them widely applicable in fields like autonomous driving, facial recognition, and medical imaging analysis.

(2) Features

**Multimodal Input and Output**: VLM can process both images and text as input and generate various forms of output, including text, images, charts, and more.

**Powerful Visual-Semantic Understanding**: With extensive knowledge accumulated from large-scale visual datasets, VLMsexcel at tasks such as object detection, classification, and image captioning.

**Visual Question Answering (VQA):** VLM can engage in natural language conversations based on the content of input images, accurately answering vision-related questions.

**Image Generation:** Some advanced VLM are capable of generating simple image content based on given conditions.

**Deep Visual Understanding:** These models can recognize intricate details within images and explain underlying logical and causal relationships.

**Cross-Modal Reasoning:** VLM can leverage visual and linguistic information together, enabling reasoning across modalities, such as inferring from language to vision and vice versa.

**Unified Visual and Language Representation Space:** By applying attention mechanisms, VLM establish deep connections between visual and semantic information, achieving unified multimodal representations.

**Open Knowledge Integration:** VLM can integrate both structured and unstructured knowledge, enhancing their understanding of image content.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Vision Language Model is primarily based on deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. Through multiple layers of neurons, these models perform feature extraction and information processing, enabling them to automatically recognize and understand complex patterns within images.

In a VLM, the input image first passes through several convolutional layers, where local features such as edges, textures, and shapes are extracted. Each convolutional layer is typically followed by an activation function (e.g., ReLU) to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex representations. Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information, helping to optimize computational efficiency.

As the network deepens, it gradually transitions from extracting low-level features (like edges and corners) to higher-level features (such as objects and scenes). For classification tasks, the final feature vector is passed through fully connected layers to predict the probability of different target categories. For tasks like object detection and segmentation, the model outputs bounding boxes or masks to indicate the location and shape of objects within the image.

Transformer-based VLM divide images into small patches, treating them as sequential data, and apply self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within the image. This approach is particularly effective at modeling long-range dependencies, enabling VLM to excel at understanding complex visual scenes.

Training VLM typically requires large-scale labeled datasets. Through backpropagation, the model optimizes its parameters to minimize the loss between predictions and ground-truth labels. Pretraining on massive datasets allows the model to acquire general-purpose visual features, while fine-tuning on specific tasks further improves performance for specialized applications.

Thanks to this design, Visual Language Models are able to process and understand visual data effectively, and are widely used in applications like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, driving rapid progress in the field of computer vision.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Image Captioning

VLM can automatically generate textual descriptions based on input images. This capability is particularly valuable for social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and accessibility technologies, such as providing visual content descriptions for visually impaired users.

② Visual Question Answering

Users can ask questions related to an image, such as "What is in this picture?" or "What color is the car?" The model analyzes the image content and provides accurate, natural-language responses, making it highly applicable in fields such as education, customer support, and information services.

③ Image Retrieval

In image search engines, users can perform searches using text descriptions, and Vision Language Model (VLM) can understand the descriptions and return relevant images. This capability is especially important on e-commerce platforms, where it allows users to find desired products more intuitively.

④ Augmented Reality (AR)

Vision Language Model (VLM) can provide real-time visual feedback and language-based explanations in augmented reality applications. When users view real-world scenes through a device's camera, the system can overlay relevant information or guidance, enhancing the overall user experience.

⑤ Content Creation and Editing

In design and creative tools, Vision Language Model (VLM) can generate relevant text content or suggestions based on a user’s visual input (such as sketches or images), helping users complete creative work more efficiently.

⑥ Social Media Interaction

On social media platforms, VLM can generate appropriate comments or tags based on user-uploaded images, enhancing engagement and interaction.

⑦ Medical Imaging Analysis

In the healthcare field, VLM can be used to analyze medical images (such as X-rays and CT scans) and generate diagnostic reports or recommendations, assisting doctors in making more accurate decisions.

### 34.1.4 Multimodal Model Basic Courses

* **Overview of Multimodal Model**

The emergence of Multimodal Model is built upon continuous advancements in the fields of Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM).

(1) Basic Concept

As LLM continue to improve in language understanding and reasoning capabilities, techniques such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting have become increasingly widespread. However, despite their strong performance on language tasks, LLM still exhibit notable limitations in perceiving and understanding visual information such as images. At the same time, VLM have made significant strides in visual tasks such as image segmentation and object detection, and can now be guided by language instructions to perform these tasks, though their reasoning abilities still require further enhancement.

(2) Features

The core strength of Multimodal Model lies in their ability to understand and manipulate visual content through language instructions. Through pretraining and fine-tuning, these models learn the associations between different modalities—such as how to generate descriptions from images or how to identify and classify objects in visual data. Leveraging self-attention mechanisms from deep learning, Multimodal Model can effectively capture relationships across modalities, allowing them to synthesize information from multiple sources during reasoning and decision-making processes.

**Multimodal Fusion Capability:** Multimodal Model can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. This fusion ability enables the models to build connections across modalities, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of information. For instance, a model can generate natural language descriptions based on an image or identify specific objects within an image based on a text query.

**Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** By integrating information from different modalities, Multimodal Model excel at contextual understanding. They can not only recognize content within a single modality but also combine clues from multiple sources to make more accurate judgments and decisions in complex tasks.

**Flexible Interaction Methods:** Users can interact with Multimodal Model through natural language instructions, making communication with the models more intuitive without requiring knowledge of complex programming or operations. For example, users can simply ask about details in an image, and the model can provide relevant answers.

**Scalability:** The architecture and training methods of Multimodal Model allow them to adapt to new modalities and tasks. As technology evolves, additional types of data—such as videos or sensor readings—can be incorporated, expanding their range of applications and capabilities.

**Strong Generative Capabilities:** Similar to large language models, Multimodal Model perform exceptionally well in generating both textual and visual content. They can produce natural language descriptions, summaries, and even create novel visual outputs, meeting a wide variety of application needs.

**Improved Reasoning Abilities:** Although challenges remain, Multimodal Model demonstrate significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to traditional single-modality models. By integrating multimodal information, they can reason effectively in more complex scenarios, supporting advanced tasks such as logical reasoning and sentiment analysis.

**Adaptability and Personalization:** Multimodal Model can be fine-tuned to meet user-specific needs and preferences, enabling highly personalized services. This adaptability offers great potential for applications in fields such as education, entertainment, and customer service.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Multimodal Model is built upon advanced deep learning and neural network technologies, with a core focus on fusing data from different modalities to understand and tackle complex tasks. At the foundation, Multimodal Model often adopt architectures similar to Transformers, which are highly effective at capturing relationships between different parts of input data. During training, these models are exposed to massive amounts of multimodal data—such as images, text, and audio—and leverage large-scale unsupervised learning for pretraining. Through this process, the models learn the commonalities and differences across modalities, enabling them to grasp the intrinsic connections between various types of information.

In practice, incoming text and visual data are first embedded into a shared representation space. Text inputs are transformed into vectors using word embedding techniques, while images are processed through methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features. These vectors are then fed into the model’s encoder, where self-attention mechanisms analyze the relationships across modalities, identifying and focusing on the most relevant information.

After encoding, the model generates a multimodal contextual representation that blends both the semantic information of the text and the visual features of the image. When a user provides a natural language instruction, the MLLM parses the input and interprets the intent by leveraging the contextual representation. This process involves reasoning and generation capabilities, allowing the model to produce appropriate responses based on its learned knowledge, or to perform specific actions in visual tasks.

Finally, the Multimodal Model’s decoder translates the processed information into outputs that users can easily understand—such as generating textual descriptions or executing targeted visual operations. Throughout this process, the emphasis is on the fusion and interaction of information across different modalities, enabling Multimodal Model to excel at handling complex combinations of natural language and visual content. This integrated working mechanism empowers Multimodal Model with powerful functionality and flexibility across a wide range of application scenarios.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Education

Multimodal Model can be used to create personalized learning experiences. By combining text and visual content, the model can provide students with rich learning materials—for example, explaining scientific concepts through a mix of images and text to enhance understanding. Additionally, in online courses, the model can dynamically adjust content based on the learner’s performance, offering customized learning suggestions in real time.

② Healthcare

Multimodal Model can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. By analyzing medical images (such as X-rays or MRIs) alongside relevant medical literature, the model helps doctors access information more quickly and provides evidence-based recommendations. This application improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

③ Entertainment

Multimodal Model can be used for content generation, such as automatically creating stories, scripts, or in-game dialogues. By incorporating visual elements, the model can provide rich scene descriptions for game developers, enhancing immersion. Additionally, on social media platforms, Multimodal Model can analyze user-generated images and text to help recommend suitable content.

④ Advertising and Marketing

Multimodal Model can analyze consumer behavior and preferences to generate personalized advertising content. By combining text and images, ads can better capture the attention of target audiences and improve conversion rates.

Finally, Multimodal Model also play a role in scientific research. By processing large volumes of literature and image data, the model can help researchers identify trends, generate hypotheses, or summarize findings, accelerating scientific discovery.

## 34.3 Multimodal Model: Voice Control

### 34.3.1 Brief Game Instructions

When the program starts, WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready` and immediately begins monitoring the surrounding environment for sounds.

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder`) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with `I am here.`

You can then control PuppyPi using voice commands—for example, say, `Hello, please take two steps forward`. After the command is recognized, the terminal will display the detected speech, the system will respond verbally, and PuppyPi will carry out the requested action.

### 34.3.2 Preparation

* **Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder.` If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi,` please refer to the tutorial titled [`28.1.6 Firmware Flashing Method`]() for step-by-step instructions.

If you have previously flashed the device with different firmware—such as the version with the wake word `小幻小幻` or `puppypi`—you must use the corresponding wake word to activate the device.

For example, if the `小幻小幻` firmware was installed, the correct wake word would be `小幻小幻`; if the `puppypi` firmware was installed, the wake word would be `puppypi.`

In the following tutorial, we will use the default factory wake word `Hello, HiWonder` for demonstration purposes.

* **Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [`34.2 Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key`]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

* **Network Configuration**

:::{Note}

The large language model used in this lesson is cloud-based. Before starting, please connect the robot to the internet using an Ethernet cable or switch it to local area network `(LAN) mode`.

:::

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [`3.5 Network Configuration Instructions`]()

### 34.3.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}

```

(4) Then, input the command to start the game:

```
ros2 launch large_models multimodel_large_models.launch.py
```

(5) Once the command line outputs the message below and the device announces `I am ready`, it indicates that the voice device has been initialized. You can now say the wake word, `hello hi wonder`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce `I am Here`, indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

You can freely express your commands to control PuppyPi's movements—for example, `Hello, please take two steps forward`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the following output appears in the command line, it indicates that WonderEcho Pro has finished recording the user's command audio and is processing it. The parsed result will be shown in the `asr_result`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(8) When the command line shows the output below, it indicates that the cloud-based large speech model's speech recognition service has successfully processed the user's command audio. The recognition result will be displayed under `publish_asr_result`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(9) When the terminal displays the following output, it means the Raspberry Pi has successfully accessed the cloud-based large language model, processed the user's command, generated a spoken response, and created a corresponding action group based on the command's intent. At this point, the robot will execute the actions outlined in the `action` sequence.

:::{Note}

The response is automatically generated by the large model, ensuring the accuracy of the meaning, though the wording and structure of the reply may vary.

:::

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

(10) When the following output appears in the terminal, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully called the cloud-based voice synthesis service. WonderEcho Pro will then play the audio generated from the `response` in step 9.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(11) Once this output appears, it means the current round of interaction has concluded. You can then say the wake word again to re-activate WonderEcho Pro and begin a new round of dialogue.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_3/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

(12) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.3.4 How It Works

* **Creates and initializes the ROS2 node**

It initializes the ROS2 environment by calling `rclpy.init()` and creates a node instance by inheriting from the Node class.

{lineno-start=130}
```python
class FunctionCall(Node):
    def __init__(self, name):
        rclpy.init()
        super().__init__(name)
```

* **Global Prompt**

Instructions corresponding to the selected language mode are provided to the language model, defining the input-output format and behavioral rules (prompts), which are then used to execute the appropriate actions.

    '''
```

* **Initializing Variables**

Define the following variables:  
action: list of actions  
llm_result: string containing the response from the large language model  
running: flag indicating the running status  
result: parsed result data

{lineno-start=135}
```python
        self.action = []
        self.llm_result = ''
        self.running = True
        self.result = ''
        timer_cb_group = ReentrantCallbackGroup()
```

* **Publisher Initialization**

(1) TTS Text Publisher: The `tts_text_pub` publishes String messages to the `tts_node/tts_text` topic, enabling speech synthesis feedback.

(2) Pose Publisher: The `pose_publisher` publishes Pose messages to the `puppy_control/pose` topic to control the robot's posture.

(3) Gait Publisher: The `gait_publisher` publishes Gait messages to both `puppy_control/gait` and `/puppy_control/gait` topics to manage gait parameters.

(4) Velocity Publisher: The `velocity_publisher` publishes Velocity messages to the `puppy_control/velocity` topic to control the robot's speed and movement.

{lineno-start=142}
```python
        self.tts_text_pub = self.create_publisher(String, 'tts_node/tts_text', 1)
        self.pose_publisher = self.create_publisher(Pose, 'puppy_control/pose', 10)
        self.gait_publisher = self.create_publisher(Gait, 'puppy_control/gait', 10)
        self.velocity_publisher = self.create_publisher(Velocity, 'puppy_control/velocity', 10)
        self.set_gait()
```

* **Service Clients and Subscribers Initialization**

(1) Return-to-Home Service: The `cli` client calls the `puppy_control/go_home` service to command the robot to return to its home position.

(2) Wake-Up Service: The `awake_client` calls the `vocal_detect/enable_wakeup` service to activate voice wake-up functionality.

(3) Kick Ball Service Client: The `kick_ball_client` sends service requests to start the kick ball activity.

(4) Line Patrol Service Client: The `visual_patrol_client` sends service requests to initiate the line patrol activity.

{lineno-start=148}
```python
        self.cli = self.create_client(Empty,'puppy_control/go_home')
        self.awake_client = self.create_client(SetBool, 'vocal_detect/enable_wakeup')
        self.awake_client.wait_for_service()
        self.create_subscription(String, 'agent_process/result', self.llm_result_callback, 1)
        self.create_subscription(Bool, 'tts_node/play_finish', self.play_audio_finish_callback, 1, callback_group=timer_cb_group)
        
        # kick_ball client
        self.enter_client_kick_ball = self.create_client(Trigger, 'kick_ball_demo/enter')
        self.enter_client_kick_ball.wait_for_service()
        
        # visual_patrol client
        self.enter_client_visual_patrol = self.create_client(Trigger, 'visual_patrol_demo/enter')
        self.enter_client_visual_patrol.wait_for_service()
```

* **Main Loop**

(1) Extract actions and response text from the large model's results.

{lineno-start=228}
```python
            if self.llm_result != '':
                if 'action' in self.llm_result:
                    self.result = eval(self.llm_result[self.llm_result.find('{'):self.llm_result.find('}') + 1])
                    if 'action' in self.result:
                        action_list = self.result['action']
                    if 'response' in self.result:
                        response = self.result['response']
                    else:
                        response = self.result
```

(2) Publish TTS text for voice synthesis

{lineno-start=239}
```python
                response_msg = String()
                response_msg.data = response
                self.tts_text_pub.publish(response_msg)
                
                self.get_logger().info(response)
                self.get_logger().info(str(action_list))
```

(3) Execute corresponding actions according to the responses returned by the large language model.

{lineno-start=246}
```python
                for a in action_list:
                    if a == "forward":
                        self.set_move(x=15.0)
                        time.sleep(1.05)
                        self.set_move(x=0.0)
                    elif a == "back":
                        self.set_move(x=-5.0)
                        time.sleep(1.05)
                        self.set_move(x=0.0)
                    elif a == "turn_left":
                        self.set_move(x=-5.0, yaw_rate=math.radians(30))
                        time.sleep(1.05)
                        self.set_move(x=0.0, yaw_rate=math.radians(0))
                    elif a.startswith("kick_ball("):
                        color = a.split("'")[1]
                        self.send_request(self.enter_client_kick_ball, Trigger.Request())
                        msg = SetString.Request()
                        msg.data = color
                        self.send_request(self.set_target_client_kick_ball, msg)
```

* **Program Analysis**

The main processing program is located at:  
[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/kick_ball_demo.py]()

* **Define an Enum Class for Program States**

{lineno-start=34}
```python
class PuppyStatus(Enum):
    LOOKING_FOR = 0  # 寻找
    LOOKING_FOR_LEFT = 1
    LOOKING_FOR_RIGHT = 2
    FOUND_TARGET = 3  # 已经发现目标
    CLOSE_TO_TARGET = 4  # 靠近目标
    CLOSE_TO_TARGET_FINE_TUNE = 5  # 细调
    KICK_BALL = 6  # 踢球
    STOP = 10
    END = 20
```

An enumeration class inheriting from Enum is defined to store and manage the main program's runtime states.

* **Initial State Check**

{lineno-start=208}
```python
                if self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR:
                    if self.haved_detect:
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.FOUND_TARGET
                        self.start_time = 0
                    else:
                        if self.start_time == 0:
                            self.start_time = time.time()
                        self.PuppyPose = self.PP['LookDown_10deg'].copy()
                        pose_msg = Pose()
                        pose_msg.stance_x = self.PuppyPose['stance_x']
                        pose_msg.stance_y = self.PuppyPose['stance_y']
                        pose_msg.x_shift = self.PuppyPose['x_shift']
                        pose_msg.height = self.PuppyPose['height']
                        pose_msg.roll = self.PuppyPose['roll']
                        pose_msg.pitch = self.PuppyPose['pitch']
                        pose_msg.yaw = self.PuppyPose['yaw']
                        self.PuppyPosePub.publish(pose_msg)
                        time.sleep(0.2)
                        time.sleep(0.8)
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR_LEFT
```

(1) At startup, the program checks its current state. If the state is `LOOKING_FOR` and the target is found, the state is updated to `FOUND_TARGET`.

(2) If the target is not found, the state switches to `LOOKING_FOR_LEFT`.

* **Search States**

(1) `LOOKING_FOR_LEFT`: The robot (Puppypi) rotates to the left to search for the target by publishing a message via `self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)`. After searching for a while without success, the state changes to `LOOKING_FOR_RIGHT`.

{lineno-start=228}
```python
                elif self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR_LEFT:
                    if self.haved_detect:
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.FOUND_TARGET
                    else:
                        velocity_msg = Velocity()
                        velocity_msg.x = float(3.0)
                        velocity_msg.y = float(0.0)
                        velocity_msg.yaw_rate = float(math.radians(-12))
                        self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)
                        time.sleep(3)
                        velocity_msg.yaw_rate = 0.0
                        self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)
                        time.sleep(0.3)
                        time.sleep(0.8)
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR_RIGHT
```

(2) `LOOKING_FOR_RIGHT`: The robot (Puppypi) rotates to the right to search for the target by publishing a message via `self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)`. After searching for a while without success, the state changes to `LOOKING_FOR_LEFT`.

{lineno-start=245}
```python
                elif self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR_RIGHT:
                    if self.haved_detect:
                        self.start_time = 0
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.FOUND_TARGET
                    else:
                        self.PuppyPose = self.PP['LookDown_10deg'].copy()
                        pose_msg = Pose()
                        pose_msg.stance_x = self.PuppyPose['stance_x']
                        pose_msg.stance_y = self.PuppyPose['stance_y']
                        pose_msg.x_shift = self.PuppyPose['x_shift']
                        pose_msg.height = self.PuppyPose['height']
                        pose_msg.roll = self.PuppyPose['roll']
                        pose_msg.pitch = self.PuppyPose['pitch']
                        pose_msg.yaw = self.PuppyPose['yaw']
                        self.PuppyPosePub.publish(pose_msg)
                        time.sleep(0.2)
                        velocity_msg = Velocity()
                        velocity_msg.x = 2.0
                        velocity_msg.y = 0.0
                        velocity_msg.yaw_rate = float(math.radians(-12))
                        self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)
```

(3) `FOUND_TARGET`: The robot checks the Y-coordinate of the target's center to determine proximity. If the value exceeds a certain threshold, the state transitions to `CLOSE_TO_TARGET`. Otherwise, Puppypi adjusts its orientation and moves toward the target based on the X-coordinate.

{lineno-start=280}
```python
                elif self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.FOUND_TARGET:
                    if self.target_info is None:
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR
                        continue
                    if self.target_info['centerY'] > 380:
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.CLOSE_TO_TARGET
                        self.PuppyPose = self.PP['LookDown_20deg'].copy()
                        pose_msg = Pose()
                        pose_msg.stance_x = self.PuppyPose['stance_x']
                        pose_msg.stance_y = self.PuppyPose['stance_y']
                        pose_msg.x_shift = self.PuppyPose['x_shift']
                        pose_msg.height = self.PuppyPose['height']
                        pose_msg.roll = self.PuppyPose['roll']
                        pose_msg.pitch = self.PuppyPose['pitch']
                        pose_msg.yaw = self.PuppyPose['yaw']
                        self.PuppyPosePub.publish(pose_msg)
                        time.sleep(0.2)
```

(4) `CLOSE_TO_TARGET`: Puppypi continues to adjust its position to ensure the target is within the desired region. If the target's Y-coordinate (e.g., centerY > 380) meets the condition, the state advances to `CLOSE_TO_TARGET_FINE_TUNE`.

{lineno-start=334.
```python
                elif self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.CLOSE_TO_TARGET:
                    if self.target_info is None:
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR
                        continue
                    if self.target_info['centerY'] > 380:
                        velocity_msg = Velocity()
                        velocity_msg.x = 0.0
                        velocity_msg.y = 0.0
                        velocity_msg.yaw_rate = 0.0
                        self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.CLOSE_TO_TARGET_FINE_TUNE
                        if self.expect_center['X'] > self.target_info['centerX']:
                            which_foot_kick_ball = 'left'
                        else:
                            which_foot_kick_ball = 'right'
```

(5) `CLOSE_TO_TARGET_FINE_TUNE`: Performs final position adjustments to prepare for the kick.

{lineno-start=356}
```python
                elif self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.CLOSE_TO_TARGET_FINE_TUNE:
                    if self.target_info is None:
                        self.puppyStatus = PuppyStatus.LOOKING_FOR
                        continue
                    if self.target_info['centerY'] < self.expect_center_kick_ball_left['Y']:
                        velocity_msg = Velocity()
                        velocity_msg.x = 4.0
                        velocity_msg.y = 0.0
                        velocity_msg.yaw_rate = 0.0
                        self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)
                        time.sleep(0.1)
```

(6) `KICK_BALL`: Puppypi halts all movement and triggers a service call to execute the kicking action. After completing the kick, the system transitions back to the `LOOKING_FOR` state, ready to begin the next cycle.

{lineno-start=396}
```python
                elif self.puppyStatus == PuppyStatus.KICK_BALL:
                    velocity_msg = Velocity()
                    velocity_msg.x = 0.0
                    velocity_msg.y = 0.0
                    velocity_msg.yaw_rate = 0.0
                    self.PuppyVelocityPub.publish(velocity_msg)
```

## 34.5 Multimodal Model: Autonomous Cruise

### 34.5.1 Brief Game Instructions

When the program starts, WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready` and immediately begins monitoring the surrounding environment for sounds.

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is `Hello, HiWonder`) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with `I am here.`

You can control PuppyPi's line-following function using voice commands, such as `Follow the black line.` PuppyPi converts the spoken command to text via the large model's ASR API, processes it through the large model, then uses the TTS API to vocalize the response and executes the corresponding line-following routine.

### 34.5.2 Preparation

* **Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder.` If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi,` please refer to the tutorial titled[`28.1.6 Firmware Flashing Method`]() for step-by-step instructions.

* **Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [`34.2 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys`]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

* **Network Configuration**

:::{Note}

The large language model used in this lesson is cloud-based. Before starting, please connect the robot to the internet using an Ethernet cable or switch it to local area network `(LAN) mode`.

:::

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [`3.5 Network Configuration Instructions`]()

### 34.5.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}

1. The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.

2. The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Double-click the `Terminator` icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image2.png" style="width:0.44653in;height:0.49306in" /> to launch the terminal and access the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Then, input the command to disable the auto-start service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Then, input the command to start the game:

```
ros2 launch large_models multimodel_large_models.launch.py
```

(5) Once the command line outputs the message below and the device announces `I am ready`, it indicates that the voice device has been initialized. You can now say the wake word, `Hello, Hiwonder`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce `I am Here`, indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

You can freely express your commands to control PuppyPi's movements—for example, `Walk forward with big steps along the black line.`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the following output appears in the command line, it indicates that WonderEcho Pro has finished recording the user's command audio.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(8) When the command line shows the output below, it indicates that the cloud-based large speech model's speech recognition service has successfully processed the user's command audio. The recognition result will be displayed under `publish_asr_result`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(9) When the command line shows the output below, it indicates that the cloud-based large language model has successfully processed the user's command, thought through the instruction, and provided a verbal response (`response`), as well as designed an action that aligns with the user's command meaning.

At this point, the robot sends client requests to the `Autonomous Cruise` node to set the color and start the game.

:::{Note}

The response is automatically generated by the large model, ensuring the accuracy of the meaning, though the wording and structure of the reply may vary.

:::

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

(10) When the following output appears in the terminal, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully called the cloud-based voice synthesis service. WonderEcho Pro will then play the audio generated from the `response` in step 9.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}

Once the Autonomous Cruise mode is activated, the program will continue running this function. To stop it, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

:::

(11) When the command line shows the output below, it indicates that one round of interaction has been completed. You can refer to Step 5) to reactivate the voice device using the wake-up word and begin a new round of interaction.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

(12) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.5.4 How It Works

Once the activity is activated, you can freely issue voice commands—for example, `Walk forward with big steps along the black line`—to guide PuppyPi in autonomous cruising mode. In this mode, PuppyPi can follow a black line or other predefined paths. If it fails to detect the guiding line for more than 3 seconds, it will automatically exit autonomous cruising and return to standby, ready to be reactivated with a new command.

| **NO.** | **Actions** | **NO.** | **Actions** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | Stand: `stand()` | 10 | Sit：`sit()` |
| 2 | Move a step forward: `forward()` | 11 | Left/ right foot kick: `kick_ball_left/right()` |

### 34.5.5 Brief Program Analysis

The launch file for this program is located at:

[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/launch/multimodal_large_models.launch.py]()

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_5/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

* **Low-Level Control**

The `ros_robot_controller_launch` command starts the low-level control node responsible for managing hardware components on the expansion board, including the buzzer and servos.

* **Launch the Camera Node**

The `usb_cam_launch` file starts the camera module, enabling access to real-time video feeds by subscribing to the camera topic.

* **Start the Motion Control Node**

The `puppy_control_launch` command starts the kinematics control node, which allows control of the robot dog's gait by subscribing to this node, enabling movement.

* **Voice Detection Node**

The `vocal_detect.launch` file starts the voice detection program. This program listens for a predefined wake word to activate the agent and converts incoming audio into text for publication.

* **Semantic Understanding Node**

The `agent_process.launch` file launches the semantic understanding module. It subscribes to the speech recognized by the voice detection node, forwards the audio to the Baidu AI agent for interpretation, and publishes the parsed results as ROS topics for subsequent processing.

* **Action Execution**

The `function_call_demo` program handles the results from Baidu's intelligent agent. It subscribes to the semantic understanding node to receive processed recognition data, executes the corresponding functions accordingly, and publishes the agent's response.

* **Response Playback**

The `tts_node.launch` file initiates the text-to-speech module, which subscribes to the response messages published by the functional nodes and vocalizes the corresponding replies.

* **Main Control Program Analysis**

The main processing program is located at:  
[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/function_call.py]()

* **Library Files Import**

The program imports the following modules and libraries to enable functionalities such as ROS2 node creation, message publishing, service calls, threading, and audio playback:

{lineno-start=1}
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# coding=utf8

from std_srvs.srv import Empty
from puppy_control_msgs.msg import Velocity, Pose, Gait
```

* **Creates and initializes the ROS2 node**

It initializes the ROS2 environment by calling `rclpy.init()` and creates a node instance by inheriting from the Node class.

{lineno-start=29}
```python
class VisualPatrolDemo(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('visual_patrol_demo')

        # 初始化变量
        self.is_shutdown = False
        self.__isRunning = False
        self.start_time = None
        self.elapsed_time = None
        self.enable_running = False

        self.__target_color = 'red'
        self.line_centerx = -1
        self.img_centerx = 320  # 图像中心点x坐标（320/2）
```

* **Global Prompt**

Instructions corresponding to the selected language mode are provided to the language model, defining the input-output format and behavioral rules (prompts), which are then used to execute the appropriate actions. For example, searching for a black line.

{lineno-start=34.
```python
if os.environ["ASR_LANGUAGE"] == 'Chinese':
    PROMPT = '''

    '''
```

* **Initializing Variables**

Define the following variables:  
action: list of actions  
llm_result: string containing the response from the large language model  
running: flag indicating the running status  
result: parsed result data

{lineno-start=135}
```python
        self.action = []
        self.llm_result = ''
        self.running = True
        self.result = ''
        timer_cb_group = ReentrantCallbackGroup()
```

* **Publisher Initialization**

(1) TTS Text Publisher: The `tts_text_pub` publishes String messages to the `tts_node/tts_text` topic, enabling speech synthesis feedback.

(2) Pose Publisher: The `pose_publisher` publishes Pose messages to the `puppy_control/pose` topic to control the robot's posture.

(3) Gait Publisher: The `gait_publisher` publishes Gait messages to both `puppy_control/gait` and `/puppy_control/gait` topics to manage gait parameters.

(4) Velocity Publisher: The `velocity_publisher` publishes Velocity messages to the `puppy_control/velocity` topic to control the robot's speed and movement.

{lineno-start=142}
```python
        self.tts_text_pub = self.create_publisher(String, 'tts_node/tts_text', 1)
        self.pose_publisher = self.create_publisher(Pose, 'puppy_control/pose', 10)
        self.gait_publisher = self.create_publisher(Gait, 'puppy_control/gait', 10)
        self.velocity_publisher = self.create_publisher(Velocity, 'puppy_control/velocity', 10)
        self.set_gait()
```

* **Service Clients and Subscribers Initialization**

(1) Return-to-Home Service: The `cli` client calls the `puppy_control/go_home` service to command the robot to return to its home position.

(2) Wake-Up Service: The `awake_client` calls the `vocal_detect/enable_wakeup` service to activate voice wake-up functionality.

(3) Kick Ball Service Client: The `kick_ball_client` sends service requests to start the kick ball activity.

(4) Line Patrol Service Client: The `visual_patrol_client` sends service requests to initiate the line patrol activity.

{lineno-start=148}
```python
        self.cli = self.create_client(Empty,'puppy_control/go_home')
        self.awake_client = self.create_client(SetBool, 'vocal_detect/enable_wakeup')
        self.awake_client.wait_for_service()
        self.create_subscription(String, 'agent_process/result', self.llm_result_callback, 1)
        self.create_subscription(Bool, 'tts_node/play_finish', self.play_audio_finish_callback, 1, callback_group=timer_cb_group)
        
        # kick_ball client
        self.enter_client_kick_ball = self.create_client(Trigger, 'kick_ball_demo/enter')
        self.enter_client_kick_ball.wait_for_service()
        
        # visual_patrol client
        self.enter_client_visual_patrol = self.create_client(Trigger, 'visual_patrol_demo/enter')
        self.enter_client_visual_patrol.wait_for_service()
```

* **Main Loop**

(1) Extract actions and response text from the large model's results.

{lineno-start=228}
```python
            if self.llm_result != '':
                if 'action' in self.llm_result:
                    self.result = eval(self.llm_result[self.llm_result.find('{'):self.llm_result.find('}') + 1])
                    if 'action' in self.result:
                        action_list = self.result['action']
                    if 'response' in self.result:
                        response = self.result['response']
                    else:
                        response = self.result
```

(2) Publish TTS text for voice synthesis

{lineno-start=239}
```python
                response_msg = String()
                response_msg.data = response
                self.tts_text_pub.publish(response_msg)
                
                self.get_logger().info(response)
                self.get_logger().info(str(action_list))
```

(3) Execute corresponding actions according to the responses returned by the large language model.

{lineno-start=246}
```python
                for a in action_list:
                    if a == "forward":
                        self.set_move(x=15.0)
                        time.sleep(1.05)
                        self.set_move(x=0.0)
                    elif a == "back":

                    elif a == "turn_left":
                        self.set_move(x=-5.0, yaw_rate=math.radians(30))
                        time.sleep(1.05)
                        self.set_move(x=0.0, yaw_rate=math.radians(0))
                    elif a.startswith("visual_patrol("):
                        color = a.split("'")[1]
                        self.send_request(self.enter_client_visual_patrol, Trigger.Request())
                        msg = SetString.Request()
                        msg.data = color
                        self.send_request(self.set_target_client_visual_patrol, msg)

Initialize the system by publishing PuppyPi's initial state and gait configuration.

* **Movement Control**

{lineno-start=216}
```python

            self.PuppyMove['yaw_rate'] = 0.0
            
        elif error > 50:
            self.PuppyMove['x'] = 8.0
            self.PuppyMove['yaw_rate'] = math.radians(-15.0)
        elif error < -50:

        self.get_logger().info(f"发布速度指令: x={velocity_msg.x}, yaw_rate={velocity_msg.yaw_rate}")
```

(1) PuppyPi adjusts its direction based on the difference between the X-coordinate of the detected line and the center X-coordinate of the image (`self.line_centerx - self.img_centerx`), enabling it to follow the line accurately.

(2) If the target line is not found, stop the robot.

* **Main program:**

{lineno-start=392}
```python
def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    visual_patrol_demo = VisualPatrolDemo()
    try:
        rclpy.spin(visual_patrol_demo)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        visual_patrol_demo.destroy_node()
        rclpy.shutdown()
```

(1) Initialize the ROS2 node and instantiate the VisualPatrolDemo class.

(2) Use `rclpy.spin()` to keep the node active.

(3) Finally, shut down and properly clean up the node.

## 34.6 Embodied AI Applications in Robotic Watchdog

### 34.6.1 Brief Game Instructions

When the program starts, WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready` and immediately begins monitoring the surrounding environment for sounds.

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is `Hello, HiWonder`) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with `I am here.`

While using this mode, you can freely issue commands to PuppyPi to check for obstacles. Upon detecting any, PuppyPi can perform specified actions such as sounding an alert or executing a predefined gesture. For example:  
`I'm about to go out. Please check for any obstacles. If there are any, make a sound and do a push-up to alert me.`

### 34.6.2 Preparation

* **Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder.` If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi,` please refer to the tutorial titled [`28.1.6 Firmware Flashing Method`]() for step-by-step instructions.

* **Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [`34.2 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys`]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

* **Network Configuration**

:::{Note}

The large language model used in this lesson is cloud-based. Before starting, please connect the robot to the internet using an Ethernet cable or switch it to local area network `(LAN) mode`.

:::

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [`3.5 Network Configuration Instructions`]()

### 34.6.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}

1. The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.

2. The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Double-click the `Terminator` icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_6/media/image2.png" style="width:0.35903in;height:0.39653in" /> to launch the terminal and access the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Then, input the command to disable the auto-start service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Enter the command to launch the corresponding game.

```
ros2 launch large_models vllm_watch_dogs.launch.py
```

(5) Once the system starts successfully, PuppyPi will say, `I am ready,` and show the live camera feed. To activate the large AI model, simply say the wake phrase, `Hello, Hiwonder.` The robot will respond with, `I am here,` confirming it is ready to interact.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_6/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce `I am Here,` indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

While using this mode, you can freely issue commands to control PuppyPi. Upon detecting any, PuppyPi can perform specified actions such as sounding an alert or executing a predefined gesture. For example:  
`I'm about to go out. Please check if there are any obstacles. If there are, make a sound and do a push-up to alert me.`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_6/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the command line displays output similar to the image below, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully called the cloud-based large language model's speech recognition service and processed the user's audio command. 

`publish llm result`: The recognized result 
`Object`: Identifies the current temperature 
`Action`: Executes the specified action based on the command  
`Response`: Plays the corresponding voice feedback

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_6/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(8) Once this output appears, it means the current round of interaction has concluded. You can then say the wake word again to re-activate WonderEcho Pro and begin a new round of dialogue.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_6/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(9) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.6.4 How It Works

PuppyPi detects obstacles in real time and performs actions according to the given commands. Simultaneously, it plays the audio generated by the cloud-based speech synthesis model.

(1) For the rules governing text responses and action design by the large model, please refer to the prompt settings within the program. Detailed instructions can be found in the PROMPT section of [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/vllm_watch_dogs.py]().

(2) The actions available in this mode are predefined within the program library and are limited in number. The core mechanism for controlling PuppyPi's movements relies on action strings (function names) generated by the large AI model. These strings are used to call corresponding executable functions from the library. If a user command involves a behavior that is not predefined for PuppyPi, the AI model may generate an unsupported action string. In such cases, the program will not be able to execute the action, and the robot will not perform the requested movement.

Use the import statement to include necessary modules and custom libraries. Examples include:

`cv_bridge`: Converts ROS image messages to OpenCV format.

`PuppyControlNode`: A robot control class responsible for executing predefined actions.

`speech`: A speech module that provides Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality.

`SetString` and `SetRunActionName`: Custom ROS services for configuring the language model and controlling actions.

`rclpy`: The Python client library for ROS 2, used to create and manage ROS nodes.

`Node`: The base class for ROS 2 nodes.

`sensor_msgs` and `std_msgs`: Message types for subscribing to image data and publishing string data, respectively.

* **Global Prompt**

Instructions corresponding to the selected language mode are provided to the language model, defining the input-output format and behavioral rules (prompts), which are then used to execute the appropriate actions.

If an obstacle is detected: identify the object by name, provide a safety alert, and execute the appropriate action.

If no obstacle is detected: return the message `No obstacles.`

{lineno-start=94}
```python
    PROMPT = '''
As an intelligent robot assistant, you can recognize obstacles in the image in real time and output item names and related prompt information in the 'response'.
Rule:
If an obstacle is identified:
-'object' returns the name of the recognized item.
-Remind the user of the location of obstacles in the 'response' and pay attention to safety.
-If the instruction contains action requirements, the corresponding 'action' must be provided based on the instruction, and the function name can only be selected from the following list:
*Standing: stand()
*Punching: boxing()
*Push ups: push_up()
*Handshake: shake_hands()
*Nodding: nod()
*Sit down: sit()
*Kick the left foot: kick_ball_left()
*Kick your right foot: kick_ball_right()
*Dancing: moonwalk()
*Get down: lie_down()
*Stretching lazily: temp()
*Being coquettish: bow()
*Call out: man()
-Example:
If the instruction is:
Check if there are any obstacles, and if there are any, let me know
You return:
```json
{
"type": "detect",
"object":  The name of the obstacle,
"action": ["man()"],
"Play": ["detect"],
"response":  There is an obstacle at the door, I'm calling to remind you to avoid it
}
```
If no obstacle is recognized:
-'Object' returns' None '.
-` action ` returns ` ["None"] `.
-Notify the user in the 'response' that there are no obstacles in the environment and remind them to pay attention to safety.
-Example:
If the instruction is:
I'm going out now, help me go to the door and see if there are any obstacles
You return:
```json
{
"type": "detect",
"object": "None",
"action": ["None"],
"Play": ["detect"],
"response":  There are no obstacles at the door, be safe and go home early
}
```
3. Just follow the above rules and return the content in JSON format without adding any other content., You can't do actions randomly. 
   You need to follow the prompts to do actions. Calling out is also an action, and it must be executed

```

* **Voice Detection Node**

The `vocal_detect.launch` file starts the voice detection program. This program listens for a predefined wake word to activate the agent and converts incoming audio into text for publication.

* **Semantic Understanding Node**

The `agent_process.launch` file launches the semantic understanding module. It subscribes to the speech recognized by the voice detection node, forwards the audio to the Baidu AI agent for interpretation, and publishes the parsed results as ROS topics for subsequent processing.

* **Response Playback**

The `tts_node.launch` file initiates the text-to-speech module, which subscribes to the response messages published by the functional nodes and vocalizes the corresponding replies.

* **Launch the Low-Level Control Node**

{lineno-start=31}
```python
    # 启动 puppy_control 节点
    puppy_control_node = Node(
        package='puppy_control',
        executable='puppy_control',
        name='puppy',
        output='screen',
        parameters=[
            {'joint_state_pub_topic': 'true'},
            {'joint_state_controller_pub_topic': 'true'}
        ]
    )
```

`puppypi_control` is responsible for managing the robot's movement and executing motion commands.

* **Launch the Camera Node**

{lineno-start=43}
```python
    # 启动 USB 摄像头节点
    camera_node = Node(

            ]
        )
```

The `usb_cam_launch` file starts the camera module, enabling access to real-time video feeds by subscribing to the camera topic.

## 34.7 Embodied AI Applications in Gender Recognition

### 34.7.1 Brief Game Instructions

When the program starts, WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready` and immediately begins monitoring the surrounding environment for sounds.

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is `Hello, HiWonder`) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with `I am here.`

To use this feature, you can freely issue voice commands for PuppyPi to recognize the gender of the person in front and perform corresponding actions.  
For example:  
`Is the person in front a boy or a girl? If it's a boy, please make a sound and then do a push-up.`

### 34.7.2 Preparation

* **Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder.` If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi,` please refer to the tutorial titled[`28.1.6 Firmware Flashing Method`]() for step-by-step instructions.

* **Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [`34.2 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys`]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

* **Network Configuration**

:::{Note}

The large language model used in this lesson is cloud-based. Before starting, please connect the robot to the internet using an Ethernet cable or switch it to local area network `(LAN) mode`.

:::

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [`3.5Network Configuration Instructions`]()

### 34.7.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}

1. The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.

2. The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Double-click the `Terminator` icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_7/media/image2.png" style="width:0.3334.in;height:0.36667in" /> to launch the terminal and access the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Then, input the command to disable the auto-start service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Enter the command to launch the corresponding game.

```
ros2 launch large_models vllm_gender_identification.launch.py
```

(5) Once the system starts successfully, PuppyPi will say, `I am ready,` and show the live camera feed. To activate the large AI model, simply say the wake phrase, `Hello, Hiwonder.` The robot will respond with, `I am here,` confirming it is ready to interact.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_7/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce `I am Here,` indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

You can freely phrase your commands to control PuppyPi. For example: `Is the person in front a boy or a girl? If it's a boy, please make a sound and then do a push-up.`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_7/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the command line displays output similar to the image below, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully called the cloud-based large language model's speech recognition service and processed the user's audio command.  
`publish llm result`: The recognized result  
`Object`: Identifies the current temperature  
`Action`: Executes the specified action based on the command  
`Response`: Plays the corresponding voice feedback

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_7/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(8) Once this output appears, it means the current round of interaction has concluded. You can then say the wake word again to re-activate WonderEcho Pro and begin a new round of dialogue.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_7/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(9) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.7.4 How It Works

(1) Once the program starts running and WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready.` To activate WonderEcho Pro, simply say the wake word `Hello, Hiwonder.` The device will respond with the voice prompt, `I am here.`

(2) Upon recognizing the speech, the system retrieves an image from the image queue and passes both the recognition result and the image to the agent for response generation.

(3) You can then control PuppyPi via voice commands. For example:  
`Is the person in front a boy or a girl? If it's a boy, please make a sound and then do a push-up.`  
WonderEcho Pro will generate a response based on the analysis and broadcast it aloud while executing the corresponding actions.

:::{Note}

1. The rules for generating text responses and corresponding actions using the large language model can be found in the prompt settings within the program, specifically in the following file:  
[/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/vllm_gender_identification.py]()

2. The actions available in this mode are predefined within the program library and are limited in number. The core mechanism for controlling PuppyPi's movements relies on action strings (function names) generated by the large AI model. These strings are used to call corresponding executable functions from the library. If a user command involves a behavior that is not predefined for PuppyPi, the AI model may generate an unsupported action string. In such cases, the program will not be able to execute the action, and the robot will not perform the requested movement.

## 34.8 Embodied AI Applications in Temperature Reporting

### 34.8.1 Brief Game Instructions

When the program starts, WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready` and immediately begins monitoring the surrounding environment for sounds.

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder`) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with `I am here.`

By using this feature, you can freely issue commands to PuppyPi to either measure the current indoor temperature or retrieve and report temperatures from other cities online.

### 34.8.2 Preparation

* **Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder.` If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi,` please refer to the tutorial titled[`28.1.6 Firmware Flashing Method`]() for step-by-step instructions.

* **Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [`34.2 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys`]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

* **Network Configuration**

:::{Note}

The large language model used in this lesson is cloud-based. Before starting, please connect the robot to the internet using an Ethernet cable or switch it to local area network `(LAN) mode`.

:::

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [`3.5 Network Configuration Instructions`]()

* **Sensor Installation**

(1) Connect the temperature and humidity sensor to the indicated I2C port.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image2.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Mount the WonderEcho Pro and, temperature and humidity sensor onto the back of the robot.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

### 34.8.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}

1. The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.

2. The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Double-click the `Terminator` icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image4.png" style="width:0.39444in;height:0.43542in" /> to launch the terminal and access the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Then, input the command to disable the auto-start service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Enter the command to launch the corresponding game.

```
ros2 launch large_models llm_temperature.launch.py
```

(5) Once the system starts successfully, PuppyPi will say, `I am ready,` and show the live camera feed. To activate the large AI model, simply say the wake phrase, `Hello, Hiwonder.` The robot will respond with, `I am here,` confirming it is ready to interact.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce `I am Here,` indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

You can freely phrase your commands to control PuppyPi, such as `What is the current indoor temperature?` or `What is the current weather temperature in Sydney?` (or any other location).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the command line displays output similar to the image below, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully called the cloud-based large language model's speech recognition service and processed the user's audio command.  
`publish llm result`: The recognized result  
`Object`: Identifies the current temperature  
`Action`: Executes the specified action based on the command  
`Response`: Plays the corresponding voice feedback

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

(8) Once this output appears, it means the current round of interaction has concluded. You can then say the wake word again to re-activate WonderEcho Pro and begin a new round of dialogue.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_8/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(9) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.8.4 How It Works

(1) Once the program starts running and WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready.` To activate WonderEcho Pro, simply say the wake word `Hello, Hiwonder.` The device will respond with the voice prompt, `I am here.`

(2) Upon recognizing the speech, the system retrieves an image from the image queue and passes both the recognition result and the image to the agent for response generation. You can then control PuppyPi by voice, for example, by saying `What is the current indoor temperature?` PuppyPi will obtain the temperature from its sensors and WonderEcho Pro will verbally deliver the generated response after processing.

:::{Note}

1. For the rules governing text responses and action design by the large model, please refer to the prompt settings within the program. Detailed instructions can be found in the PROMPT section of [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/llm_temperature.py]()

2. The actions available in this mode are predefined within the program library and are limited in number. The core mechanism for controlling PuppyPi's movements relies on action strings (function names) generated by the large AI model. These strings are used to call corresponding executable functions from the library. If a user command involves a behavior that is not predefined for PuppyPi, the AI model may generate an unsupported action string. In such cases, the program will not be able to execute the action, and the robot will not perform the requested movement.

        try:
            self.bus = smbus.SMBus(bus)
            self.addr = addr
            time.sleep(0.2)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"AHT10初始化失败: {e}")

    def getData(self):
        try:
            self.bus.write_i2c_block_data(self.addr, 0xAC, self.MEASURE)
            time.sleep(0.5)
            data = self.bus.read_i2c_block_data(self.addr, 0x00)
            temp = ((data[3] & 0x0F) << 16) | (data[4] << 8) | data[5]
            ctemp = ((temp * 200) / 1048576) - 50
            return ctemp
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"读取温度失败: {e}")
            return None
```

This module reads data from the temperature sensor (AHT10). It initializes the sensor by specifying the I2C bus and device address.

Sensor data is read via the I2C protocol and converted to Celsius. Finally, it outputs the current temperature value (`ctemp`).

## 34.9 Embodied AI Applications in Scene Understanding

### 34.9.1 Brief Game Instructions

When the program starts, WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready` and immediately begins monitoring the surrounding environment for sounds.

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is `Hello, HiWonder`) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with `I am here.`

By engaging in this activity, you'll use PuppyPi to recognize the current environment, generate insightful analysis, and deliver a spoken report—all while freely organizing your own language expressions.

### 34.9.2 Preparation

* **Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware**

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is `Hello, Hiwonder.` If you wish to change the wake-up word to `PuppyPi,` please refer to the tutorial titled[`28.1.6 Firmware Flashing Method`]() for step-by-step instructions.

* **Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key**

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [`34.2 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys`]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

* **Network Configuration**

:::{Note}

The large language model used in this lesson is cloud-based. Before starting, please connect the robot to the internet using an Ethernet cable or switch it to local area network `(LAN) mode`.

:::

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [`3.5 Network Configuration Instructions`]()

### 34.9.3 Starting and Stopping the Game

:::{Note}

1. The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.

2. The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Double-click the `Terminator` icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_9/media/image2.png" style="width:0.41528in;height:0.45833in" /> to launch the terminal and access the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Then, input the command to disable the auto-start service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Enter the command to launch the corresponding game.

```
ros2 launch large_models vllm_with_camera.launch.py
```

(5) Once the system starts successfully, PuppyPi will say, `I am ready,` and show the live camera feed. To activate the large AI model, simply say the wake phrase, `Hello, Hiwonder.` The robot will respond with, `I am here,` confirming it is ready to interact.

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce `I am Here,` indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

Feel free to phrase your commands in your own words when interacting with PuppyPi—for example: `What do you see? Please describe the scene.`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_9/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the command line displays the output shown below, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully accessed the cloud-based speech recognition service powered by the large language model. The message `publish vllm result` represents the recognized result of the user's voice command.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_9/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(8) Once this output appears, it means the current round of interaction has concluded. You can then say the wake word again to re-activate WonderEcho Pro and begin a new round of dialogue.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_9/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(9) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.9.4 How It Works

(1) Once the program starts running and WonderEcho Pro announces `I am ready.` To activate WonderEcho Pro, simply say the wake word `Hello, Hiwonder.` The device will respond with the voice prompt, `I am here.`

(2) Upon recognizing the speech, the system retrieves an image from the image queue and passes both the recognition result and the image to the agent for response generation. From there, you can control PuppyPi using voice commands—for example: `What scene do you see? Please describe it.` PuppyPi will use its camera to capture the surroundings, analyze the scene, and deliver a spoken response through the WonderEcho Pro.

:::{Note}

1. For the rules governing text responses and action design by the large model, please refer to the prompt settings within the program. Detailed instructions can be found in the PROMPT section of [/home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models/vllm_with_camera.py]().

2. The actions available in this mode are predefined within the program library and are limited in number. The core mechanism for controlling PuppyPi's movements relies on action strings (function names) generated by the large AI model. These strings are used to call corresponding executable functions from the library. If a user command involves a behavior that is not predefined for PuppyPi, the AI model may generate an unsupported action string. In such cases, the program will not be able to execute the action, and the robot will not perform the requested movement.

* **Voice Detection Node**

The `vocal_detect.launch` file starts the voice detection program. This program listens for a predefined wake word to activate the agent and converts incoming audio into text for publication.

* **Semantic Understanding Node**

The `agent_process.launch` file starts the semantic understanding program. It subscribes to the text output from the voice detection node, processes the input to interpret user intent, and publishes the results as ROS topics.

* **Response Playback**

The `tts_node.launch` file initiates the text-to-speech module, which subscribes to the response messages published by the functional nodes and vocalizes the corresponding replies.

* **Launch the Low-Level Control Node**

{lineno-start=31}
```python
    # 启动 puppy_control 节点
    puppy_control_node = Node(
        package='puppy_control',

            {'joint_state_controller_pub_topic': 'true'}
        ]
    )
```

`puppypi_control` is responsible for managing the robot's movement and executing motion commands.

* **Launch the Camera Node**

{lineno-start=43}
```python
    # 启动 USB 摄像头节点
    camera_node = Node(

:::{Note}

1. The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.

2. The robot must be connected to the internet, either in `STA (local network) mode` or `AP (direct connection) mode` via Ethernet.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Double-click the `Terminator` icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop <img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image2.png" style="width:0.45278in;height:0.50069in" /> to launch the terminal and access the ROS2 development environment.

(3) Then, input the command to disable the auto-start service:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Then, input the command to start the game:

```
ros2 launch large_models vllm_track_start.launch.py
```

(5) Once the system starts successfully, PuppyPi will say, `I am ready,` and show the live camera feed. To activate the large AI model, simply say the wake phrase, `Hello, Hiwonder.` The robot will respond with, `I am here,` confirming it is ready to interact.

You'll be able to freely issue commands to PuppyPi to pick up objects, such as: `Help me grab the green block.`

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the command line displays output similar to the image below, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi has successfully called the cloud-based large language model's speech recognition service and processed the user's audio command.  
`publish llm result`: The recognized result  
`Object`: Identifies the current temperature  
`Action`: Executes the specified action based on the command  
`Response`: Plays the corresponding voice feedback

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(8) Once this output appears, it means the current round of interaction has concluded. You can then say the wake word again to re-activate WonderEcho Pro and begin a new round of dialogue.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(9) To exit this feature, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. If it doesn't close on the first attempt, you may need to press it multiple times.

### 34.10.5 Function Expansion

If the color detection of the object is unsatisfactory during the game, it may be necessary to adjust the robotic arm's grasping range. The instructions are as below:

(1) Enter the following command and press `Enter` to navigate to the directory where the program is located:

```
cd /home/ubuntu/ros2_ws/src/large_models/large_models
```

(2) Run the following command to open the program file:

```
vim puppy_controller.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Find the program file, then modify the values of `self.y_close_lower = 410` and `self.y_close_upper = 420` according to the observed results. The larger the value, the farther back the end-effector gripper position; conversely, the smaller the value, the farther forward it is.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Press the `i` key to enter edit mode.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_34/section_10/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

(1) Subscribe to the `image_raw` topic to receive raw image data, which is processed via `self.image_callback`.

(2) `color_tracking/enter`: Trigger entry into color tracking mode.

(3) `color_tracking/enable_color_tracking`: Enable or disable the color tracking function.

(4) `color_tracking/set_color`: Set the target color to track.

(5) `color_tracking/stop`: Stop the color tracking.

`llm_tracking.py`: Manages the configuration of the large language model and sets the global PROMPT.

* **Global Prompt**

{lineno-start=78}
```python
    PROMPT = '''
Role:
You are an intelligent four-legged robotic dog focused on action planning, decoding human instructions, and describing the upcoming sequence of actions in a humorous way to make the interaction fun.

Skills:
Command Interpretation & Creative Expression
- Smart Decoding: Instantly grasp the core intent of the user's command.
- Dynamic Sequencing: Based on the decoding results, construct a series of coherent and logically connected action commands.
- Witty Responses: Craft a short (5-20 words) and humorous feedback for each action sequence, adding fun to the interaction.

Skill Details:
- Action Command Construction: Ensure action commands are accurate and smooth to execute.
- Response Art: The responses should be unique, amusing, and strictly adhere to the length limitation.

Technical Specifications:
- Output Format: Strictly follow JSON format, starting with `{` and ending with `}`. Only provide a list in the output.
- Structure Requirements:
    - The "type" key should hold a string representing the type of action (action or detection).
    - The "action" key should contain an array of function names in the execution order. If no corresponding action function is found, output an empty array [].
    - The "response" key should include a well-thought-out short response, perfectly fitting the word count and style requirements.
    - The "object" key should contain either "detect" or "ocr". If the semantic meaning is not action, output "".
    - The "position" key should contain detect or ocr as well. If not an action, output an empty array [].
- Special Handling: For the functions kick_ball and visual_patrol, the parameters should be precisely enclosed in double quotes.

Principles of Implementation:
- Perform a comprehensive verification before final output, ensuring the response is not only format-compliant but also filled with humor and creativity.

Type Categories:
- The "type" key can only be "action", "ocr", or "detect". Other types are invalid.
- Color objects should only return "red", "blue", or "green". Other colors should not return any action, and the response should mention the color is missing and requires additional reference material.
- For color capture, only the grab and stop functions should be used, with no others.

Example Action Functions Descriptions (all functions are limited to these):
- You see something? image_understanding("image recognition")

Example Task 1: Grabbing a red color block:
{
  "type": "detect",
  "action": ["grab"],
  "response": "Grabbing the red color block",
  "object": "red",
  "position": {}
}

Example Task 2: Stop grabbing:
{
  "type": "detect",
  "action": ["stop"],
  "response": "Stopped grabbing",
  "object": "",
  "position": {}
}
"""
    '''
```

Instructions corresponding to the selected language mode are provided to the language model, defining the input-output format and behavioral rules (prompts), which are then used to execute the appropriate actions.

If a target is recognized: provide the color and object name, then execute the corresponding action.

If no matching color block is detected, return the message: `No blue block detected ahead.`

Subscribe to image data and results from the large language model as needed.

* **Initialize Language Model and Actions:**

```

Set Prompt: Send customizable instruction prompts to the large language model via service calls.

Load Model: Specify and load the desired model, such as vllm or others.

Start Image Processing Thread: Begin image processing by calling the appropriate method (e.g., `process()`).

* **Image Processing:**

    def extract_json(self, data):
        """
        从数据字符串中提取 JSON 内容。
        移除代码围栏并确保 JSON 完整。

        data = re.sub(r'^```json\s*', '', data)
        data = re.sub(r'```$', '', data)

        # 使用正则表达式查找 JSON 对象
        match = re.search(r'({.*})', data, re.DOTALL)

```

Set the robot's initial pose, gait parameters, and target color.

Load configuration file: load color range data (`self.lab_data`) from the config file.

* **Set control states for the robot dog at different stages:**

{lineno-start=17}
```python
class PuppyStatus(Enum):
    IDLE = 0
    START = 1
    NORMAL = 2
    FOUND_TARGET = 3
    ADJUSTING_YAW = 4
    ADJUSTING_X = 5
    STOP = 10
```

Used to control behaviors such as idle, start, normal movement, target detected, adjusting direction, etc.

* **Determine grasping range:**

{lineno-start=147}
```python
    def is_within_clamp_range(self, y, x_error):
        y_close = self.clamp_y_lower < y <= self.clamp_y_upper
        x_close = abs(x_error) < self.clamp_x_error_thresh

        return y_in_range and x_in_range and color_correct
```

Used to decide whether the robot has reached the grasping position.

* **Motion control method: move**

This is an infinite loop thread function that controls the robot dog's movement based on its current state (`self.status`):

(1) `START`: Initialize the robot dog's posture and transition into a crouching position.

(2) `NORMAL`: Adjust the robot dog's movement direction and speed according to the target's position, attempting to approach the target.

(3) `ADJUSTING_YAW`: Adjust the robot dog's yaw angle to keep the target centered in its field of view.

(4) `ADJUSTING_X`: Adjust the robot dog's forward direction to position the target properly for grasping.

(5) `FOUND_TARGET`: When the target is within the grasping range, perform the grasping action.

(6) `STOP`: Stop the robot dog's movement and return to a standing posture.

* **Voice Detection Node**

The `vocal_detect.launch` file starts the voice detection program. This program listens for a predefined wake word to activate the agent and converts incoming audio into text for publication.

* **Semantic Understanding Node**

The `agent_process.launch` file launches the semantic understanding module. It subscribes to the speech recognized by the voice detection node, forwards the audio to the Baidu AI agent for interpretation, and publishes the parsed results as ROS topics for subsequent processing.

* **Response Playback**

The `tts_node.launch` file initiates the text-to-speech module, which subscribes to the response messages published by the functional nodes and vocalizes the corresponding replies.

`puppypi_control` is responsible for managing the robot's movement and executing motion commands.

* **Launch the Camera Node**

The `usb_cam_launch` file starts the camera module, enabling access to real-time video feeds by subscribing to the camera topic.
