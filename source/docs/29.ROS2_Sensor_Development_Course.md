### 29.1.2 Glowy Ultrasonic Sensor Introduction

The ultrasonic ranging chip integrates ultrasonic transmitting circuit, receiving circuit, digital processing circuit, etc. This module adopts IIC communication interface through which the measured distance can be read.

Besides, on each probe, there is RGB light whose brightness can be adjusted and parameters of color channel can be modified to change the color.  

### 29.1.3 Program Logic

Firstly, set the distance range. Then control RGB colored light to light on or get out though the change of the level. Lastly, control the color of light through changing the parameter of color channels.

The source code of this program is stored in [ros2_ws/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/sonar_avoidance.py]()

### 29.1.4 Operation Steps

:::{Note}

Commands must be entered with strict attention to capitalization and spaces.

:::

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_26/section_1/media/image3.png"  /> at upper left corner to to open Terminator ROS2. 

(3) Run the following command to disable the ros node.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Execute the following command to star the game.

```
ros2 launch example sonar_control_demo.launch.py
```

(5) If need to close this program, we can press **Ctrl+C**. If it fails to close, please try again.

### 29.1.5 Program Outcome

After the program starts, place an obstacle in front of the glowy ultrasonic sensor. Then the measured distance will be printed on the terminal. And the RGB colored light will illuminate in corresponding color according to the distance.

**Distance ≤ 300mm**: red light on.

**300mm≤ Distance ≤ 500mm**: green light on.

**Distance ≥500mm**: blue light on.

### 29.1.6 Function Extension

* **Modify Distance Range**

The corresponding distance range of different light colors can be modified. For example, we set green light to turn on when **300<distance<550**, and blue light to turn on when **distance>550**.

(1) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_26/section_1/media/image3.png" style="width:70px" /> at upper left corner to open Terminator.

(2) Enter the following command to switch to the directory containing the programs:

```
cd ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor
```

(3) Enter the following command and press Enter to open the gameplay program file:

```python
vim sonar_control_demo.py
```

(4) Locate the code section highlighted in the image below. Press the “**i**” key to enter edit mode.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_29/section_1/media/image14.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Modify the data as illustrated.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_29/section_1/media/image15.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When you finish editing, press the "**Esc**" key. Then type "**:wq**" (with a colon) and press Enter to save your changes and exit.

* **Customizing RGB Light Colors**

You can also change the color of the RGB lights. This example demonstrates how to change the light color from red to yellow by following these steps:

(1) Refer to steps (1) and (2) in Section 6.1: Adjust the Detection Distance for the RGB Light to open the gameplay program file.

(2) In the opened file, locate the code segment highlighted below. Press the "**i**"key to enter edit mode.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_29/section_1/media/image16.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Adjust the RGB values to change the light color. 

Replace `s.setRGB(1,(255,0,0))` and `s.setRGB(0,(255,0,0))` with `s.setRGB(1,(255,255,0))`and `s.setRGB(0,(255,255,0))` as shown in the example.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_29/section_1/media/image17.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}

RGB values correspond to the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue components of a color. By mixing these primary colors in varying proportions, any color can be produced. When the values are similar, the color tends toward gray or white/black tones. Higher values produce lighter colors (closer to white), while lower values produce darker colors (closer to black).

:::

(4) After modification, press **Esc**, input **:wq** and press Enter to save the modified data.

### 29.3.2 Touch Sensor Introduction

Based on capacitive sensing, Hiwonder touch sensor can sense the touch from human body or metal. In addition, the contact between plastic, paper and other materials of certain thickness can also be sensed. Its sensitivity is related to contact area and material thickness.

After powering, signal terminals OUT will output high-level signal when sensor does not sense the touch signal. When the touch signal is sensed, signal terminal OUT will output low-level signal. It is applicable in switch control, such as light switch and doorbell touch buttons. The holes on the module are compatible with Lego for more creative DIY designs.

### 29.3.3 Program Logic

When sensing the touch, touch sensor will output high level, otherwise out low level. We can judge the status of the sensor through the level change of I/O interface.

The source code of this program is stored in the Docker container [ros2_ws/src/example/example/puppypi_with_sensor/touch_detect_demo.py]()

GPIO.input function is used to acquire the value given by touch sensor so as to judge the status of the sensor.

### 29.3.4 Operation Steps

(1) Power on the robot, then follow the steps in  [3.3 Docker Container Introduction and Entry]() and [3.4 ROS Version Switch Tool Guide]() to connect via the VNC remote control software and switch to the ROS 2 environment.

(2) Click <img src="../_static/media/chapter_26/section_1/media/image3.png" style="width:70px" /> at upper left corner to initiate the Terminator ROS2 terminal.

(3) Disable the ros node by entering the following command:

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(4) Execute the following command to start the game.

```
ros2 launch example touch_detect_demo.launch.py
```

### 29.3.5 Program Outcome

After the program starts, buzzer will beep once when sensing the touch on metal plate.

### 29.4.2 Dot Matrix Display Introduction

Dot matrix display module composed of two 8x8 LED dot matrix screens, which can be controlled through driving the control chip. It features high brightness, no-flicker display, convenient wiring, etc. And it can display various content, including number, text, pattern, etc.

### 29.4.3 Program Logic

In this program, a set of hexadecimal data is used to control the dot matrix screen to display the content. A set of hexadecimal data consists of 16 data each of which controls a column of LED.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_29/section_4/media/image21.png" class="common_img" style="width:400px" />

It is simple to set the data. For example, control the dot matrix display to display **Hello**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_29/section_4/media/image22.png" class="common_img" />

The parameter in brackets of 32nd and 33rd line are the array for setting the displayed pattern. The converted binary number of its first element `0x7f` is 01111111 which represents the light status, that is off on on on on on on on.

As the same, the rest 15 elements are also for controlling the LED lights to display "**Hello**".

:::{Note}

You can find "Instructions for Using the Font Software" in the same directory of this section, where you can quickly obtain control arrays using the font software.
